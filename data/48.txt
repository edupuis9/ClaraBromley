ENVOI. 

WHETHER  it  may  ever  be  my  lot  to  revisit  the  sunny 
land  I  have  endeavoured  to  paint  in  the  foregoing- 
pages  I  know  not.  I  parted  from  it  with  much 
regret,  and  shall  ever  bear  the  grateful  recollection 
that  the  year  I  spent  on  the  other  side  of  the  Atlantic 
was  the  happiest  and  most  peaceful  period  of  my  life, 
from  the  days  of  childhood  until  the  present  time.

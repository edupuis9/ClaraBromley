1,"ST.  THOMAS,  July  17th,  1853. — We  arrived  here, 
my  dear  Father,  this  morning,  after  a  prosperous  and 
pleasant  voyage  of  fifteen  days.  I  can  scarcely  persuade myself  yet  that  the  past  fortnight  is  not  a 
dream  ;  that  I  really  am  in  another  hemisphere,  and 
another  clime ;  that  the  view  I  am  now  contemplating 
of  this  beautiful  island,  its  deep  blue  sky  and  tropical 
vegetation,  will  not  dissolve  itself  into  the  Apsley 
gardens  and  the  statue  of  Achilles,  or  some  equally 
familiar  home  scene.  However,  assuming  that  I  am 
awake,  I  will,  according  to  promise,  note  down  for 
your  amusement  (I  hope)  during  your  few  hours  of 
leisure,  all  my  doings  and  adventures  in  their  due 
course.  The  first  few  days  after  leaving  Southampton  were  chiefly  occupied  in  ""  fixing  ""  ourselves, 
and  making  acquaintance  one  with  another,  neither 
of  which  was  attended  with  much  difficulty,  as  fortunately neither  Eleanor  nor  I  have  suffered  at  all  from 
sea-sickness.  On  the  seventh  day  we  sighted  the 
Azores,  especially  the  island  of  St.  Michael,  and  were 
able  just  faintly  to  discern  the  Peak  of  Pico.  I  was 
sorry  not  to  be  allowed  to  land ;  but  the  rules  of  the 
packet  service  forbid  touching  anywhere  on  the  way, 
except  in  a  case  of  necessity.  We  have  had  the 
advantage  of  two  captains  during  the  voyage,  as, 
besides  Captain  Woolley,  who  commands  our  beautiful Parana,  we  are  accompanied  by  Captain  Abbott, 
who  joins  his  own  ship,  which  has  been  out  here 
under  repair.  Our  fellow-passengers  have  been 
mostly  agreeable  and  kindly-disposed  people,  gathered 
indeed  from  many  different  nations.  We  formed  a 
miniature  Babel  between  us  in  point  of  tongues  ;  but 
luckily  there  was  neither  quarrel  nor  disagreement, 
and  I  believe  we  shall  all  part  and  go  on  our  respective ways  now  with  mutual  regret.  I  must  not  for- 
get to  tell  you  that  I  have  been  persuaded  by  two  or 
three  experienced  travellers  in  these  countries,  to 
change  the  route  I  had  originally  intended  to  take, 
and  instead  of  paying  my  visit  at  Barbados  now,  and 
proceeding  to  America  later  in  the  season,  I  propose 
going  at  once  to  Havana,  thence  make  a  short  tour  in 
the  United  States,  and  return  south  to  Barbados  in 
October  or  November.  There  is  some  risk,  I  am 
told,  of  being  snowed  up  and  detained  for  months  in 
America  when  travelling  so  late  in  the  year.  .  .  . 
Finding  that  the  Clyde  (the  steamer  bound  for 
Havana)  does  not  sail  till  to-morrow  at  mid-day,  we 
went  on  shore  this  morning,  and  took  a  drive  about 
the  town  and  environs,  a  friend  of  Captain  Abbott's 
having  good-naturedly  organised  a  carriage  and  pair 
of  horses  to  be  in  readiness  for  us.  The  yellow  fever 
is  still  raging  in  St.  Thomas,  I  am  sorry  to  hear, 
though  its  violence  has  much  abated'  during  the  last 
few  weeks.  It  is  now  chiefly  confined  to  the  ships  in 
the  harbour,  especially  that  part  where  the  coaling 
takes  place ;  but  both  town  and  land  are  now  comparatively free  from  the  scourge.  It  is  singular, 
however,  that  no  one  speaks  of  it  as  a  thing  they 
feared  in  the  least  degree.  A  row  of  about  ten 
minutes  brought  us  to  the  shore,  and  for  the  first  time 
I  trod  not  on  European  ground.  St.  Thomas  is  not 
generally  named  ad  a  favourable  specimen  of  a  tropical 
climate ;  but  it  is  so  new  to  me,  and  the  change  is  in 
every  respect  so  complete  from  all  we  left  on  the 
other  side  of  the  Atlantic,  as  to  be  sufficient  to  please 
by  its  novelty  alone.  What  richness  of  colour  pervades everything, — land,  sea  and  sky  seem  to  vie  with 
each  other  in  depth  and  gorgeousness  of  hue.  At  the 
risk  of  horrifying  and  displeasing  my  compatriots,  for 
good  and  all,  I  must  aver  that  I  never  knew  before
what  real  green  trees  and  green  grass  were.  One  peculiarity of  the  vegetation  here  I  cannot  understand, 
namely,  that  with  a  tropical  sun  absolutely  blazing 
all  day,  and  with  pretty  nearly  equal  violence  throughout the  year,  yet  nothing  seems  burnt ;  leaves,  trees, 
and  plants  look  as  fresh  as  spring.  Now  in  England 
or  France,  or  any  temperate  climate,  a  fortnight 
uninterrupted  summer  sunshine  is  enough  to  burn, 
dry  up,  and  change  the  colour  of  everything;  in 
short,  the  glory  of  the  summer  would  have  departed. 
I  suppose  there  must  be  some  way  of  accounting  for 
this  singularity,  but  for  my  part,  I  must  apply  to 
some  wiser  head  than  my  own  to  elucidate  it.  There 
are  palm  trees  in  abundance  here,  the  principal  features in  all  my  beau-ideal  landscapes.  I  observed 
in  the  course  of  our  drive,  the  banyan,  tamarind, 
and  mango,  hitherto  only  known  at  home  in  our  hothouses. I  admire  the  tamarind  leaf  exceedingly ;  it 
is  so  graceful.  Also  I  must  not  omit  mentioning  my 
introduction  to  a  sugar  plantation,  which,  however, 
did  not  make  so  pleasing  an  impression  as  other  new 
arborical  acquaintances.  They  (the  sugar  canes) 
look  like  a  forest  of  rushes  ;  but  the  people  here  tell 
me  I  should  wait  to  see  them  in  flower  before  pronouncing the  fiat  of  ""  ugly  ""  upon  them.  En  revanche 
I  may  be  permitted  irrevocably  so  to  designate  the 
inhabitants,  i.  e.  the  black  people.  I  could  scarcely 
have  imagined  anything  so  hideous  as  a  black  baby, 
and  I  don't  know  which  was  worst,  one  I  saw  about 
six  months  old,  in  white  swaddling  clothes,  or  another 
just  able  to  toddle  alone,  and  who,  instead  of  being 
a  rosy,  dimpled  little  cherub,  as  might  be  expected, 
was  as  black  as  ink,  and,  moreover,  stark  naked. 
With  the  grown-up  female  population,  however,  deficiency of  dress  cannot  be  complained  of;  every 
colour  in  the  rainbow  is  pressed  into  the  service, 
and  generally  at  the  same  time — the  more  the  better 
they  seem  to  think ;  yellow,  sky-blue  and  pink  seem 
the  fashionable  tints,  and  dresses  are  generally  worn 
flounced  up  to  the  waist.  Neither  shoes  nor  stockings are  usually  worn,  except  on  Sundays  to  go  to 
church,  and  then  the  former  are  of  white  satin !  I 
was  nearly  forgetting  to  chronicle  almost  the  only  remarkable curiosity  belonging  to  this  island,  namely, 
a  gigantic  cotton  tree.  I  am  afraid  to  trust  my 
memory  as  to  its  age  or  size,  though  both  were  told 
me,  but  its  proportions  are  most  colossal,  and  the 
shapes  assumed  by  its  gnarled  and  twisted  branches 
are  most  extraordinary.  The  tree,  altogether,  would 
form,  in  the  outline,  a  very  good  representation  of 
the  Laocoon  magnified  a  hundred  times.  .  .  . 
The  time  had  now  come  to  bid  farewell  to  the  Parana 
and  our  ocean  friends,  which  we  did  with  real  regret. 
A  long  voyage  makes  one  become  quite  attached 
even  to  inanimate  things  :  I  was  really  grieved  to 
quit  my  little  cabin.  There  are  only  four  of  our  old
companions  going  on  with  us  to  Havana,  the  rest  are 
to  scatter  themselves  far  and  wide  in  every  direction. 
St.  Thomas  is  the  central  spot  whence  radiate  all 
routes  to  other  parts  of  the  western  hemisphere. 
The  Clyde  seems  quite  a  nutshell  after  the  Parana. 
She  is  commanded  by  Captain  Wilson,  a  son  of  the 
Bishop  of  Calcutta.  I  shall  close  my  letter  now,  as 
the  mail  starts  for  England  very  early  to-morrow 
morning. — Ever  your  affectionate, 

C."
2,"Fonda  de  los  Americanos,  Havana.  —  My  dear 
Father, — We  landed  here  yesterday,  and  I  resume  the 
narrative  of  my  progress,  although  this  sea  travelling 
is  such  an  easy  nonchalant  sort  of  life,  it  makes  one 
quite  idle,  but  as  the  weather  is  somewhat  hot  I  shall 
be  sorry  to  leave  the  sea  for  the  land  journey.  On 
the  19th  and  20th  we  coasted  along  San  Domingo 
and  Porto  Kico,  but  did  not  touch  at  either.  Early 
in  the  morning  of  the  22nd  the  lighthouse  of  Havana 
was  in  sight,  and  at  4  o'clock  P.M.  we  entered  the 
harbour.  I  had  heard  in  England  that  the  entrance 
to  Havana  was  a  scene  of  all  but  matchless  beauty ; 
this,  however,  I  think  is  exaggerated ;  very  beautiful 
it  truly  is,  and  the  immense  palm  trees  fringing  its 
shore,  give  it  a  character  peculiarly  its  own :  still  I 
think  the  ports  of  Naples,  Genoa,  and  above  all, 
Corfu,  may  successfully  vie  with  it  in  magnificence  of 
scenery.  We  were  very  nearly  being  obliged  to 
limit  our  acquaintance  with  Havana  to  its  harbour, 
and  having  to  go  on,  in  spite  of  ourselves,  to  Vera 
Cruz,  in  consequence  of  our  passport  not  having 
been  vise  by  the  Spanish  consul  at  St.  Thomas. 
The  police  were  inexorable.  ""  We  must  go  on,""  at 
least  we  must  not  stay.  It  was  in  vain  we  assured 
them  we  were  not  conspirators,  or  worse  still,  Americans. We  were  not  en  regie,  that  was  certain,  so  we 
must  not  remain.  As  things  began  now  to  look  serious, 
I  thought  it  better  to  try  what  Senor  Isturiz's  letters 
would  do  ;  so  I  sent  the  one  to  the  Captain-general, 
writing  a  note  to  him  myself,  at  the  same  time  stating 
the  circumstances  and  our  dilemma.  In  the  mean 
time,  awaiting  his  reply,  we  went  on  shore,  as  that  is 
allowed  for  transitory  passengers.  Not  a  little  to 
my  relief,  and  I  must  confess  to  my  astonishment, 
the  Spanish  ambassador's  letter  had  a  most  magical 
effect.  To  begin  with :  the  Captain-general  sent  the 
royal  boat  to  bring  us  on  shore,  and  finding  we  had 
already  gone,  they  took  our  luggage,  consequently 
there  was  no  custom-house  searching,  as  on  ne  touche 
pas  a  la  Reine  or  her  conveyances.  The  next  surprise that  awaited  me  was  in  the  shape  of  an  aide-de- 
camp, dressed  in  full  scarlet  and  gold  (the  Spanish 
uniform  is  almost  the  same  as  our  Guards),  who  came 
charged  with  a  message  to  the  effect  that  the  Captain- 
general  himself,  and  all  that  he  had,  was  at  my  disposition. This  sounds  somewhat  wonderful  to  a 
stranger,  but  it  is  nevertheless  the  general  mode  of 
expression  used  by  the  Spanish  people  of  all  classes. 
If  you  remark  on  anything  belonging  to  them  in 
terms  of  praise,  they  say  immediately,  ""  It  is  yours,"" 
or  a  su  disposition  de  usted :  at  your  disposal.  Of 
course  this  is  not  intended  to  be  taken  literally,  still 
it  is  a  courteous  and  kindly  phrase.  Having  replied 
to  the  aide-de-camp  in  as  civil  English  as  I  could 
muster,  we  proceeded,  it  being  now  about  eight 
o'clock,  to  the  Plaza  d' Armas,  a  large  square,  or 
rather  garden,  in  front  of  the  palace,  where  we  are 
told  a  military  band  plays  every  night.  But  we  were 
little  prepared  for  the  scene  that  awaited  us.  I  can 
liken  it  to  nothing  but  the  last  scene  of  some  fairy 
piece  at  a  play :  groups  of  glorious  palm  trees  standing in  bold  relief  against  the  glittering  starry  sky, 
the  moon  shedding  floods  of  light  on  the  spray  of  a 
fountain  playing  in  the  centre  of  the  Plaza ;  the 
flowers,  the  music,  and  then  the  women !  As  if  still 
further  to  heighten  the  resemblance  to  a  play,  or  I 
should  now  rather  say,  to  a  ballet,  the  senoras  and 
seiioritas  were  all  in  full  evening  costume ;  wreaths 
of  flowers  or  jewels  worn  by  all.  They  sauntered 
about  with  the  graceful  and  indolent  walk  peculiar 
to  the  Spanish,  and  flirting  both  with  their  eyes  and 
their  fans,  in  a  manner  which,  had  I  been  a  man, 
must  have  been  highly  detrimental  to  my  head  or 
heart,  or  both.  Still  I  do  wish  I  were  either  a  painter 
or  a  poet,  that  I  might  at  least  describe  my  impression 
in  something  better  than  this. 

23rd — Took  a  drive  this  morning  in  a  volante,  a 
species  of  carriage  peculiar  to  Havana,  a  most  curious 
affair,  and  difficult  to  describe. — A  cabriolet  body, 
placed  rather  low  and  forward ;  two  gigantic  wheels 
almost  at  the  back ;  traces  of  excessive  length  terminating with  a  horse,  mounted  by  a  diminutive  black 
postillion,  who  is  generally  equipped  either  in  green 
or  crimson  velvet  and  large  top-boots.  These  volantes  hold  two  persons,  and  sometimes  three ;  they 
are  very  comfortable  and  easy,  the  seat  being  so  well 
poised,  and  the  springs  quite  elastic.  We  wandered 
about  the  town  looking  at  the  outside  of  the  various 
buildings.  The  Moro,  or  lighthouse,  placed  on  a  steep 
rock  at  the  entrance  to  the  harbour,  nearly  grown 
over  with  the  bright  flowers  and  leaves  of  the  cactus, 
gives  great  beauty  to  the  general  coup  $ceil  of  the 
landscape.  The  palace,  the  prison,  the  new  operahouse,  called  the  Tacon,  from  Greneral  Tacon,  who 
built  it  during  his  vice-royalty  here ;  the  fort  of 
Santa  Clara,  the  Paseo  or  public  promenade,  and  the 
cathedral  (the  burial-place  of  Christopher  Columbus), 
were  principal  points  of  interest  in  our  drive  to-day. 
Bu£  as  at  present  we  are  here  only  en  passant  and 
mean  to  make  a  longer  stay  on  our  return,  I  shall 
reserve  till  then  any  more  detailed  account.  On 
coming  in  to  dinner  I  found  a  note  from  the  Captain- 
general,  hoping  we  would  do  him  the  honour  of 
attending  the  opera  at  night,  and  that  he  would  send 
his  carriage  to  convey  us  there  at  the  proper  time. 
Accordingly,  at  eight  o'clock,  a  very  pretty  barouche 
drove  up,  and  this  time  two  aides-de-camp  came  to 
escort  us,  and  in  about  ten  minutes  we  arrived  at  the 
Tacon  theatre,  and  were  ushered  into  the  royal  box. 
There  were  two  magnificent  chairs,  or  rather  thrones, 
with  the  crown  and  arms  of  Spain  carved  above  each. 
We  were  about  to  seat  ourselves  in  some  more  humble places,  but  were  told  the  Captain-general  had 
desired  we  should  fill  the  seats  of  honour  ;  so  recollecting Louis  XIV.'s  lessons  on  good  breeding,  on  a 
somewhat  similar  occasion,  I  thought  it  better  to  do 
as  I  was  told  without  further  demur,  though  for  a 
few  moments  I  could  not  help  feeling  nervous,  as 
every  pair  of  eyes  in  the  house  were  turned  upon  me. 
Soon,  however,  I  forgot  all  about  myself  in  wonder 
and  in  admiration  of  this  singularly  beautiful  theatre. 
All  the  boxes  are  open,  that  is  to  say,  the  occupants 
are  seen  from  head  to  foot,  which,  it  need  not  be 
said,  adds  much  to  the  fine  effect  of  the  whole,  the 
sides  and  fronts  of  the  boxes  being  delicately  carved 
in  open  gold  trellis-work.  The  ceiling  alone  is 
painted,  and  that  very  beautifully,  and  the  backs  of 
the  boxes  are  covered  with  fluted  silk  and  lace  draperies. Wrapped  in  contemplation  of  this  brilliant 
scene,  I  had  not  heard  the  door  open,  and  was  considerably startled  by  a  voice  at  my  ear  announcing 
the  speaker  ""  was  at  my  feet.""  I  speedily  got  upon
mine,  and  made  my  first  reverence  to  the  Captain- 
general,  and  was  about  taut  bien  que  mal  to  make  a 
Spanish  speech  to  him,  when,  to  my  great  relief,  he 
addressed  me  in  French ;  so  all  was  plain  sailing  then. 
Greneral  Canedo  is  a  fine  soldierly-looking  man, 
about  fifty  years  of  age,  not  handsome  in  face  (with 
the  exception  of  the  eyes),  but  with  a  kind,  benevolent expression,  a  good  voice,  and  a  thorough  gentleman, as  may  be  seen  at  a  glance.  The  opera  was 
changed  after  all  for  a  comedy,  in  consequence  of  the 
illness  of  one  of  the  singers. 

During  the  week  we  have  passed  here  whilst  waiting the  sailing  of  the  steamer,  we  have  gone  about 
Havana  and  its  environs.  The  Paseo  or  Alameda, 
the  place  where  the  Havanese  betake  themselves 
every  evening  for  riding  and  driving,  reminds  me 
rather  of  the  Champs  Elysees,  only  here  the  avenues 
and  plantations  are  all  of  palm  trees.  About  a  mile 
and  a  half  from  the  town  is  a  suburb  called  the 
""  Cerro,""  where  most  of  the  aristocracy  and  some  of 
the  merchants  have  country-houses,  or  ""  Quintas,""  as 
they  are  called.  The  gardens  attached  to  these 
Quintas  are  delightful — a  wilderness  of  trees,  flowers, 
and  fruit.  We  passed  two  or  three  evenings  with  the 
Captain-general  at  his  Quinta,  played  billiards,  ate 
pine  apples,  and  sauntered  about  the  gardens.  He 
was  always  good-natured  enough  to  load  us  with 
flowers  when  we  returned,  and  such  beautiful  ones. 
I,  especially,  always  managed  to  get  a  beautiful  bunch 
of  stephanotis. 

Yesterday  morning  went  to  the  cathedral  to  visit  the 
tomb  of  Christopher  Columbus  ;  a  plain  marble  slab, 
with  a  short  inscription,  is  all  there  is  to  tell  of  him. 
I  cannot  understand  how  a  generous  and  noble- 
natured  people  like  the  Spanish  should  have  allowed 
the  remains  of  one  to  whom  they  owe  so  much  to  lie 
neglected  and  almost  forgotten.  That  he  should  be 
buried  here,  in  the  land  he  found  and  won,  is  right 
and  just,  as  well  as  in  accordance  with  his  own  d}dng 
wishes  ;  but  where  is  the  sculptured  monument? 
Where  the  glowing  epitaph  which  should  be  seen 
above  the  grave  of  Columbus? 
 "
3,"August  4th.  —  We  have  now  been  waiting  here 
twelve  days  for  the  Isabel  Segunda  steamer.  She 
arrived  at  length,  and  we  came  on  board  last  night  to 
sleep,  as  daybreak  was  the  time  fixed  for  sailing  this 
morning.  We  have  a  wonderful  collection  of  people, 
some  of  them  not  of  the  choicest  description,  and  who 
look  very  much  out  of  place  in  the  beautiful  crimson 
and  gold-decorated  saloon,  from  a  corner  of  which  I 
am  writing  to  you.  The  heat  is  something  indescribable, notwithstanding  the  sea-breeze ;  and,  as  you  may 
imagine,  there  being  a  bright  moonlight,  we  were  glad 
to  remain  on  deck  the  greater  part  of  the  night,  instead of  going  to  the  hot,  close,  little  cabin  assigned 
to  us  for  sleeping  quarters. 

Friday,  5th. — We  touched  this  morning  at  a  place 
called  Key  West,  for  the  purpose  of  taking  on  board 
a  lot  of  turtles.  Poor  things  !  it  is  melancholy  to  see 
them  flapping  and  floundering  about  the  deck,  awaiting their  fate  and  their  turn  to  be  converted  into 
soup  !  Two  of  our  Cuban  friends,  who  are  proceeding 
to  New  York  direct  in  the  Isabel,  wish  to  persuade 
us  to  do  likewise ;  but  this  stifling  heat  is  unbearable ; 
so  we  shall  adhere  to  our  original  plan  of  travelling 
there  by  land  from  Charleston,  of  which  place  we 
are  just  now  in  sight,  so  I  must  go  on  deck  to  take 
my  first  look  at  the  continent  of  America. 
The  entrance  to  the  harbour  is  remarkably  wide, 
about  two  miles  across.  It  is  formed  by  the  junction 
of  two  rivers,  the  Ashley  and  the  Cooper,  the  former 
of  which  is  considerably  upwards  of  6000  feet  in 
width,  and  the  latter  4000  feet.  The  approach  and 
the  crossing  of  the  bar  are  difficult,  and  in  stormy 
weather  must  be  dangerous  enough  ;  shoals  and 
quicksands  abound.  To-day,  though  perfectly  calm 
and  fine,  our  boat  pitched,  and  rolled,  and  whirled 
about  in  the  most  distracted  manner  before  succeeding in  making  good  her  entrance  into  the  port. 
Charleston  is  at  present  in  a  very  flourishing  condition, being  the  richest  as  well  as  the  most  populous 
town,  or  rather  city,  I  believe  it  is  more  correctly 
termed,  of  South  Carolina.  Cotton,  rice,  and  tobacco 
are  the  principal  products  of  the  state ;  but  of  these 
the  two  first  form  much  the  larger  portion  of  the 
trade  carried  on.  After  taking  some  dinner  at  the 
hotel,  we  procured  a  vehicle  (I  have  yet  to  learn 
what  they  are  termed  here,  —  whether  cabs,  flies, 
coaches,  or  carriages,  but  they  are  not  volantes 
at  all  events),  in  which  we  proceeded  to  find  out 
what  we  could  of  the  celebrities  of  the  place.  The 
streets  are  wide,  clean,  and  airy;  the  houses  not 
altogether  ugly,  in  spite  of  their  being  made  of 
red  brick.  Some  handsome  public  buildings,  including the  Exchange,  City  Hall,  and  Citadel,  but 
we  were  most  pleased  with  the  public  promenade, 
which  extends  for  a  considerable  distance  by  the 
water  side,  and  is  thickly  planted  with  trees.  From 
this  spot  a  very  fine  view  is  obtained  of  the  harbour 
and  forts,  and  the  ocean  beyond.  Charleston  seems 
most  unusually  protected  by  strong  places.  If  I 
remember  rightly,  we  counted  four  forts  independently of  the  citadel.  Of  these  the  most  famous 
and  interesting,  to  us  at  least,  is  Fort  Moultrie  on 
Sullivan's  Island,  very  near  to  the  harbour,  where 
the  English  under  Sir  Peter  Parker  were  repulsed 
in  the  War  of  Independence  in  1776.  As  you  may 
suppose,  we  being  Englishwomen,  were  very  especially informed  of  our  national  defeat.  Having 
enjoyed  our  drive  very  much,  we  finished  off  with 
going  to  witness  the  departure  of  the  Isabel  with  our 

two  friends  the  D 's  on  board,  continuing  their 

route  to  New  York.  And  now,  for  the  first  time 
since  parting  from  you  at  Southampton,  we  are 
alone,  that  is  to  say,  we  shall  set  out  on  our  travels 
to-morrow  unaccompanied  by  any  one  we  know  or 
have  ever  seen  before.  I  must  make  this  letter 
shorter  than  usual,  being  a  good  deal  tired  by  the 
heat  and  crowd  on  our  voyage  from  Havana,  and 
our  departure  to-morrow  being  very  matinal.  Moreover, the  first  portion  of  our  journey  is  to  be  again 
aquatic,  in  accordance  with  the  suggestion  and  advice 
of  the  people  here,  and  we  take  the  steamer  to  a 
place  called  Wilmington. — Yours  ever,

4,"AFTER  a  long  and  not  over  pleasant  sea  and  land 
'journey  from  Charleston,  we  are  now,  my  dear 
father,  comfortably  ""  located ""  for  the  day  here, 
namely,  at  Kichmond,  in  a  large,  cheerful,  and,  as 
we  saw  it  last  night  on  our  arrival,  brilliantly 
lighted  hotel.  But  before  saying  anything  of  this 
place,  I  must  begin  at  the  beginning,  and  chronicle 
our  movements  since  I  last  wrote.  Our  departure 
from  Charleston  did  not,  for  some  reason  best 
known  to  the  powers  on  board  the  steamer,  take 
place  till  the  afternoon,  instead  of  the  morning; 
the  sky  was  lowering,  atmosphere  oppressive,  and 
boat  crowded ;  and  to  make  matters  better,  when  we 
had  been  about  four  hours  at  sea,  we  met  with  a 
Job's  comforter,  in  the  shape  of  the  chief  engineer 
of  the  vessel,  who  informed  us  that  the  particular 
point  we  were  then  turning,  and  which  bore  the 
ominous  name  of  Cape  Fear,  was  the  most  dangerous 
spot  on  all  the  southern  coast ;  that  the  heavy  cloud 
we  saw  ""  looming  in  the  distance,""  was  the  probable 
forerunner  of  a  squall ;  also,  that  a  vessel,  for  which 
the  one  we  were  on  board  was  a  substitute,  had  been 
lost  on  just  such  a  night  as  this,  on  her  return 
voyage,  having  previously,  however,  landed  Jenny 
Lind  in  safety  on  the  outward  bound  trip.  Here 
was  a  pretty  catalogue  of  disasters  !  Decidedly  our 
friend  must  have  had  the  mischievous  design  of 
upsetting  our  nerves  :  notwithstanding  all  these  black 
prognostications,  the  night  passed  without  any  misadventure, and  we  reached  Wilmington  yesterday 
morning  in  safety ;  a  busy-looking,  commercial  town, 
but  containing  nothing  worthy  of  note  in  other 
respects.  It  owes  its  rise,  if  not  its  existence,  to 
being  the  terminus  of  the  immense  line  of  railroad 
from  north  to  south  of  the  United  States.  To  make 
up  for  the  absence  of  the  threatened  gale  of  wind 
at  night,  the  rain  poured  down  with  such  extreme 
violence,  that  in  walking  over  the  short  space  of 
about  twenty  yards  from  the  landing  to  the  railway 
train,  where  the  ""  cars  ""  were  in  waiting,  we  got 
completely  wet  through.  The  carriages,  or  cars  as 
they  are  called  here,  differ  considerably  in  their 
construction  from  those  on  the  European  railroads. 
Each  car  is  of  exceeding  length,  and  instead  of  being 
in  compartments  with  doors  at  the  sides,  you  enter 
at  the  back,  and  find  a  lane,  on  the  principle  of  the 
aisle  of  a  church,  straight  through  the  centre  of  the 
car,  with  rows  of  benches  on  either  side  for  the 
accommodation  of  the  passengers.  These  benches  have 
reversible  backs;  so  that  you  may  sit  fronting  the 
engine  or  not  as  you  prefer.  I  am  not  sure  on  the 
whole  that  I  like  these  American  cars ;  it  seems  to 
me  that  you  are  not  sufficiently  protected  against 
the  weather  ;  there  are  no  means  of  ventilation, 
except  by  keeping  the  windows  open ;  and  this  necessarily, of  course,  let  in  a  quantity  of  wet  in  the 
beginning  of  the  journey.  By  and  by  as  we  proceeded the  rain  ceased,  and  the  sun  began  absolutely 
to  blaze, — shine  is  too  mild  an  expression.  The  heat 
and  dust  then  became  insufferable  ;  added  to  which, 
the  ashes  and  cinders  from  the  engine  blew  in  upon 
us  in  showers,  penetrating  every  nook  and  corner, 
and  certainly  neither  contributing  to  our'  comfort 
nor  cleanliness.  We  looked  like  a  set  of  sweeps 
before  reaching  our  journey's  end.  In  other  respects 
the  regulations  are  good  enough.  The  travelling  is 
fast,  very  cheap,  and  lastly,  all  the  people,  employes, 
and  others  are  kindly  and  civilly  disposed  towards 
women.  The  general  aspect  of  the  country  we  have 
traversed  is  strange  and  wild.  We  have  passed  over 
upwards  of  300  miles  of  one  nearly  unvaried  scene, 
trees  and  water,  water  and  trees.  Every  now  and 
then  a  small  clearance  had  been  made,  the  stumps 
being  left,  showing  where  the  trees  had  been ;  and 
two  or  three  houses  were  built,  rarely  more ;  but  a 
very  few  years,  they  tell  me,  will  suffice  to  convert 
these  small  beginnings  into  considerable  towns.  The 
grand  old  names  belonging  to  some  of  these  embryo 
""  cities ""  are  at  times  ludicrous.  Warsaw,  for  instance, consists  of  exactly  four  houses.  I  should  not 
omit  to  mention  that  the  line  of  railroad  I  have  just 
been  describing  is  laid  along  the  outskirts  or  margin 
of  the  great  morass  immortalised  by  Moore's  poetry, 
called  ""The  Lake  of  the  Dismal  Swamp,""  which 
will  account  for  the  aquatic  character  of  the  greater 
portion  of  the  route.  Dismal  enough  it  looked 
certainly,  especially  as  night  drew  on.  The  last 
cheerful-looking  place  we  saw  was  called  Petersburg, 
where  we  stopped  for  refreshment,  a  pretty,  green- 
looking  spot,  and  apparently  in  a  thriving  condition. 
About  two  hours  before  arriving  at  Richmond,  it 
being  then  quite  dark,  we  had  to  cross,  by  means 
of  a  very  long  bridge,  a  dreary  marsh  or  fen  water 
surrounding  us  on  every  side,  and  the  extreme  distance only  bounded  by  the  dark  outline  of  a  sombre 
forest ;  our  train  looking  like  a  thread  on  the  waste 
of  waters:  the  scene  was  altogether  appalling,  and 
greatly  relieved  I  felt  when  we  had  safely  crossed  it. 
By  day,  no  doubt,  it  would  look  less  terrible,  but  the 
effect  at  night  is  by  no  means  pleasant.  I  had 
nearly  forgotten  to  tell  you  of  a  curious  notice  I  saw 
posted  up  at  the  railway  station  at  Wilmington.  It 
purported  to  state  the  fares  on  some  short  line,  I 
cannot  tell  what,  between  Wilmington  and  whatever 
the  place  may  have  been.  It  ran  thus  :  ""  (rents  and 
ladies  75  cents,  children  and  slaves  35  cents  !  ""  As 
you  are  aware,  there  is  no  first  or  second  class  in 
American  travelling.  Persons,  therefore,  are  charged 
all  equally,  but  children  and  slaves  it  should  appear 
do  not  count.  Eichmond,  where  we  arrived  at  length 
last  night,  is  the  capital  town  of  Virginia,  and  is 
remarkably  picturesque  in  its  general  character. 
The  private  houses,  as  well  as  many  of  the  public 
buildings,  are  mostly  enclosed  in  ornamental  grounds, 
planted  with  shrubs  and  trees.  These,  together  with 
there  being  a  waterfall  in  the  immediate  vicinity, 
the  falls  of  the  James  Biver,  on  which  the  town  is 
built,  combine  to  render  Eichmond  somewhat  more 
of  a  show  place  than  might  be  expected  of  a  manufacturing town.  We  paid  a  short  visit  to  the  capitol, 
which  stands  in  the  midst  of  a  very  tastefully-planted 
square  or  park,  serving  as  a  pleasure-ground  and 
promenade  for  the  public.  Clumps  and  avenues 
of  fine  trees,  with  a  quantity  of  grass-plots  intersected with  paths  and  gravel-walks.  Inside  the 
building  there  stands  facing  you  as  you  enter  the 
hall,  a  well-executed  statue  of  Washington  in  white 
marble.  I  do  not  know  the  sculptor's  name, — indeed, 
to  tell  the  truth,  I  forgot  to  ask.  There  are  several 
cotton  factories  here,  but  the  principal  source  of 
industry  is  tobacco.  About  fifty  manufactories  are 
in  action  at  the  present  moment,  each  employing 
an  average  of  150  to  200  hands,  black  hands,  of 
course ;  and  I  am  told  that  both  the  population  and 
commercial  prosperity  of  Richmond  are  steadily 
increasing  every  year.  To-morrow  we  proceed  northwards, and  expect  to  reach  Washington,  so  I  will 
write  no  more  to  you  now,  but  take  up  my  narrative 
again  when  our  journey  thither  is  accomplished. "
5,"August  9th.  —  Left  Richmond  at  7  A.  M.,  and  after 
about  five  hours  in  the  train,  reached  a  place  they 
call  Aquia  Creek,  where  we  embarked  on  a  steamer, 
the  Baltimore,  which  conveyed  us  up  the  river 
Potomac  to  Washington,  a  pleasant  little  voyage  ; 
the  banks  of  the  river  green  and  pretty,  though 
tame.  In  this  part  of  the  United  States  there  is 
much  resemblance  to  our  counties  of  Kent  and 
Surrey.  Green  fields,  orchards,  and  a  kitchen- 
gardeny  look  about  the  country,  added  to  red  brick 
houses  in  the  towns,  still  further  increases  the  likeness. The  people,  however,  are  different  in  almost 
every  respect.  Nothing  strikes  me  more,  as  an 
Englishwoman,  than  the  interest,  or  as  some  call 
it,  the  curiosity,  displayed  by  the  people  here  about 
the  affairs  of  strangers.  They  guess,  reckon,  or 
calculate  upon  all  your  actions,  and  even  your 
motives.  Nevertheless,  I  am  never  inclined  either 
to  think  or  treat  this  inquisitiveness  as  an  impertinence, and,  moreover,  I  do  not  think  they  mean 
it  themselves  as  such ;  I  believe  it  arises  from  their 
desire  to  compare  themselves,  their  sayings  and 
doings,  with  every  stranger  they  come  across,  and 
in  their  anxiety  to  do  this,  they  occasionally  lose 
sight  of  the  bounds  of  good  breeding.  On  the 
other  hand  we  English  go  into  an  opposite  extreme. 
The  indifference  with  which  we  view  everybody  we 
do  not  know,  the  fright  we  are  in  lest  we  should 
know  some  one  who  is  not  as  high  up  as  ourselves 
in  the  social  scale.  And  as  to  asking  questions! 
I  suspect  if  we  could,  Asmodeus-like,  look  into 
the  minds  of  nineteen  out  of  twenty  travellers  who 
meet  each  other  at  home,  their  reflexions  would 
run  somewhat  as  follows :  ""  I  don't  care  where  you 
live  or  what  you  are,  where  you  come  from  or 
where  you  are  going  to,  and  I  only  hope  you  are 
not  going  to  speak  to  me.""  But  though,  as  I  have 
said,  I  do  not  think  the  Americans  mean  rudeness 
by  their  curiosity,  they  are  quite  the  most  conceited 
people  possible;  their  comparisons,  which  I  have 
before  mentioned,  are  never  by  any  chance  turned 
to  their  own  disadvantage.  Whatever  the  subject, 
trivial  or  important,  theirs  is  the  victory,  ""they 
beat  all  creation.""  And  yet,  until  the  Americans 
cure  themselves  of  some  of  their  personal  habits, 
to  which  it  would  be  disagreeable  more  particularly 
to  allude,  I  think  they  can  scarcely  be  suffered 
to  class  themselves  among  civilised  nations,  and 
certainly  not  among  civilised  society.  I  have  rarely 
seen,  on  our  side  of  the  Atlantic,  peasants  or  artisans 
so  offensive  in  their  personal  actions  as  I  regret  to 
say  those  who  call  themselves  American  gentlemen. 
Apropos  of  peculiarities  and  habits,  I  am  rather 
amused  at  the  announcements  printed  and  hung 
up  behind  all  the  room  doors  in  the  hotels  on  the 
subject  of  stealing.  We  must  at  least  give  them 
credit  for  the  candour  with  which  they  acknowledge 
their  propensities  towards  thieving  or  annexing,  as 
I  suppose  they  would  call  it  themselves.  You  are 
solemnly  warned  by  these  notices  always  to  lock 
your  door  and  remove  your  key  when  you  leave 
the  room,  ""if  you  wish  to  avoid  being  robbed,"" 
and  to  bolt  your  door  inside  at  night  ""for  fear 
of  night  visitors."" — To  return  to  our  voyage  after 
this  long  digression.  About  fifteen  miles  below 
Washington,  we  passed  Mount  Vernon,  the  residence and  burial-place  of  the  patriot.  We  could 
barely  distinguish  the  monument;  but  the  place 
seemed  very  still  and  well  formed  for  a  refuge  from 
the  turmoil  of  public  life. 

August  10th. — I  forget  what  author  remarks  on 
Washington,  that  ""it  is  a  city  of  magnificent  intentions."" The  expression  is  very  well  chosen.  It 
might  be,  and  should  the  day  ever  dawn  on  its 
entire  completion,  it  will  be  most  splendid.  Seen 
from  a  little  distance  few  towns  in  the  world  could 
compare  with  it,  but  on  a  near  view  the  charm  dissolves. Everything  is  being  built,  nothing  finished ; 
and  even  those  buildings  which  to  all  appearance 
are  complete  and  unexceptionable,  do  not  satisfy 
the  prevailing  mania.  They  will  not  let  well  alone, 
but  must  be  ever  altering,  enlarging,  improving, 
and  what  not,  until  the  whole  place  resembles  a 
stone-mason's  yard,  instead  of  the  metropolis  of  a 
state,  and  the  seat  of  its  government.  The  capitol 
is  a  most  magnificent  structure,  and  might  very 
well  vie  with  the  architectural  chefs-d'oeuvre  of 
Rome  or  Athens,  were  it  only  left  in  peace.  But 
they  must  ""  go  ahead,""  and  accordingly  have  begun 
to  build  two  wings,  which  will  not,  I  think,  improve 
the  original  design ;  and,  en  attendant)  obliges  one 
to  wade  through  stones,  dust,  and  marble  on  every 
side.  The  interior  of  the  capitol  is  very  simple, 
the  only  ornamental  part  being  immediately  under 
the  dome,  which  is  used  apparently  as  a  sort  of 
lobby  by  the  members  of  Congress  between  the 
acts  of  their  debates.  This  dome  is  hung  round 
with  pictures,  by  American  artists,  of  the  principal 
events  in  their  country's  history.  They  include 
the  baptism  of  Pocahontas,  the  discovery  of  America 
by  Christopher  Columbus,  and  the  landing  of  the 
Pilgrim  Fathers.  The  rest  are  devoted  to  the 
various  memorable  episodes  in  the  life  of  George 
Washington.  Of  these  the  most  remarkable  and 
the  most  frequently  repeated  on  their  canvass  are 
those  occasions  on  which  the  enemy  surrendered  to 
him.  From  the  summit  of  the  steps  of  the  capitol, 
and  at  the  end  of  a  long  avenue  of  noble  trees, 
is  seen  the  colossal  statue  of  Washington,  with  the 
following  short  but  graceful  inscription  on  the 
pedestal :  ""  Greorge  Washington,  the  first  in  peace, 
the  first  in  war,  and  the  first  in  the  hearts  of  his 
countrymen.""  Taken  as  a  whole,  the  effect  of 
this  is  very  fine,  the  charming  scenery  of  the  background, the  windings  of  the  Potomac,  the  fine 
old  trees  which  completely  screen  the  city  from 
view,  all  unite  to  give  the  capitol  an  air  of  solitary 
grandeur.  The  Post-office,  the  Treasury,  the  President's house,  and  the  Patent-office  are  each  and 
all  superb  buildings,  seen  from  a  little  distance, 
as  we  did  in  taking  a  carriage  drive  round  the 
environs.  The  impression  given  by  this  distant 
view  is  that  Washington  is  one  of  the  most  splendid 
towns  in  the  world ;  but  alas  !  the  illusion  is  soon 
dispelled.  The  buildings  are  there,  certainly,  but 
not  one  of  them  is  finished ;  the  streets  are  laid 
out  and  named  with  the  most  ludicrous  regularity, 
but  for  the  most  part  are  guiltless  of  houses.  Brick- 
dust,  stone-dust,  and  marble-dust  nearly  suffocate 
you  at  every  step,  besides  being  lamed  in  stumbling 
over  stones  and  splinters  of  every  description  in  your 
path.  A  memorial  has  been  begun  to  be  erected 
to  Washington,  and  all  the  states  of  the  Union 
contribute  something  to  it  in  the  shape  of  a  piece 
of  sculptured  marble.  Each  piece  is  to  be  employed 
and  placed  somewhere  when  the  whole  is  completed ; 
but  when  will  that  be,  I  wonder  ?  The  people  themselves give  half  a  century  before  they  expect  its 
completion.  The  worst  of  it  is,  judging  from  the 
model,  I  think  it  will  be  but  an  ugly  affair  after 
all.  The  drawing  resembles  a  large  manufacturing 
chimney.  We  returned  to  our  hotel  (Brown's,  Pennsylvania  Avenue)  tired  and  almost  bewildered  with 
our  wanderings  about.  How  wonderfully  cheap, 
and  generally  speaking,  how  very  good  the  American 
hotels  are !  This*  one  we  are  at,  for  instance,  we 
have  two  very  nice  rooms,  drawing-room  and  bedroom; the  meals  are  breakfast,  dinner,  tea,  and 
supper,  all  of  which  are  plentifully  supplied  with 
the  best  food  and  a  great  variety,  and  for  which 
everything,  light  and  all  included,  the  charge  is 
a  dollar  and  a  half  each  per  diem.  They  give  you 
a  menu  when  you  come  down  to  breakfast  of 
the  morning's  provision, —  eggs,  omelettes,  kidneys, 
""  chicken-fixings,""  cutlets,  mushrooms,  are  the  usual 
items  from  which  you  select  what  you  like.  Then 
there  is  an  endless  variety  of  bread  made  of  Indian 
corn,  hominy,  and  other  sorts  of  grain,  but  I  cannot, 
at  least  yet,  like  any  of  these,  they  are  so  very  heavy, 
so  I  generally  adhere  to  buttered  toast,  which  they 
do  to  perfection.  As  I  am  about  to  proceed  to 
supper,  the  long  drive  having  made  me  remarkably 
hungry,  I  shall  resume  my  letter  to-morrow,  after 
having  visited  some  more  of  the  Washington  objects 
of  interest. 

This  morning  was  occupied  in  the  inspection  of 
several  of  the  public  buildings  of  which  we  had 
only  seen  the  exterior  yesterday.  These  were  the 
Patent-office,  the  Post-office,  the  Smithsonian  Institute, and  the  President's  house.  The  Patent-office  is  really  a  noble  building,  and  fortunately  it 
is  not  only  finished,  but  speaking  comparatively, 
it  may  almost  be  termed  an  ancient  structure.  It 
was  one  of  the  very  few,  indeed  I  believe  it  was 
the  only  one,  of  the  great  institutions  which  escaped 
destruction  in  1814,  when  our  English  general  Eoss, 
by  his  famous  coup-de-main,  marched  upon  Washington, and  before  the  surprised  enemy  could  offer 
any  effectual  resistance,  had  set  fire  to  the  capitol, 
including  its  library,  the  docks,  the  Treasury,  the 
President's  abode,  the  war-office,  a  great  bridge, 
and  two  or  three  ships  of  war, — a  pretty  good  day's 
work  !  But  the  Patent-office,  as  I  have  said,  escaped 
the  general  conflagration,  owing,  they  say,  to  the 
strong  intercession  of  its  then  director.  The  building is  of  white  marble,  and  in  the  Italian  style  of 
architecture.  One  very  beautiful  room,  which  is 
devoted  to  the  reception  of  the  various  inventions 
for  which  patents  have  been  obtained,  is  upwards 
of  120  feet  long,  and  is  adorned  with  a  double  row 
of  marble  columns,  supporting  an  arched  roof  finely 
sculptured  with  bas-reliefs.  From  this  we  went  to 
the  Post-office,  also  a  handsome  marble  structure, 
and  thence  to  the  President's,  called  also  the  ' f  white 
house.""  The  congress  not  being  in  session  now,  both 
this  and  the  capitol  are  deserted,  so  that  one  may 
roam  over  them  at  pleasure.  The  white  house  is 
singularly  simple  and  unpretending  in  its  interior 
decoration,  certainly  it  cannot  fairly  be  termed  a 
palace,  and  it  is  scarcely  equal  to  a  tolerably  well- 
appointed  private  abode.  Before  leaving  this  part 
of  the  city  we  visited  the  Congress  library,  which 
we  had  not  entered  previously.  It  is  in  one  wing 
of  the  capitol,  and  contains  28,000  volumes.  We 
closed  our  peregrinations  by  the  inspection  of  the 
Smithsonian  Institute,  one  of  the  many  examples 
of  private  benevolence  and  liberality  abounding 
throughout  the  States.  It  is  a  curious  and  picturesque-looking building  of  a  red  granite  and  in 
the  old  turretted  style  of  architecture.  It  has  ten 
towers,  one  in  the  centre  much  higher  than  the 
others.  We  were  not,  however,  admitted  beyond 
the  grounds,  a  lecture  being  in  course  of  delivery. 
As  perhaps  I  shall  have  no  other  opportunity  of 
despatching  a  letter  before  arriving  at  New  York, 
I  shall  send  this  off  to-night,  for  ""  I  calculate  ""  it 
will  just  catch  the  English  mail.     It  would  amuse 

you   to   hear  how  beautifully  E imitates  the 

Yankee  twang.     I  am  not  so  clever  at  it  by  a  long 
way,  but  with  her  it  sounds  quite  genume.     Adios. 
Ever  your  affectionate

6,"Baltimore,  August  16th.  —  My  dear  Father,  — We 
came  here  yesterday  afternoon,  in  about  an  hour  and 
a  half  from  Washington.  The  country  through  which 
we  passed  was  very  beautiful,  and  I  should  have 
admired  it  still  more  but  that  I  thought  once  or 
twice  we  were  going  to  ""  eternal  smash,""  as  they  say 
here.  We  travelled  much  faster  than  I  ever  recollect 
doing  in  England,  and  frequently  far  too  rapidly  to  be 
safe.  The  distance  between  Washington  and  Baltimore is  but  forty  miles,  and  an  hour  and  a  half  for  traversing that  space  would  have  been  moderate  enough, 
but  a  very  considerable  delay  took  place  at  a  station 
called  Annapolis,  and  then  I  suppose  to  make  up  lee 
way  they  found  it  necessary  to  go  like  ""  greased  lightning ! ""  What  immoderate  water-drinkers  the  Americans are !  There  is  water  in  the  trains,  water 
in  the  boats,  water  in  the  railway-stations,  water 
in  the  drawing-rooms,  and  to  make  matters  worse, 
at  dinner  (I  am  speaking  of  the  table  d'hote  dinners 
on  the  road),  instead  of  taking  a  little  wine  or  beer, 
like  people  in  general,  they  drink  oceans  of  milk 
diluted  with  water.  It  is  to  me  most  unpleasant 
to  look  at,  especially  when  accompanying  rich  entrees 
and  sauces,  not  to  speak  of  fat  pork,  which  is  also  a 
very  favourite  dish,  but  does  not  in  my  opinion 
look  at  all  agreeable  in  juxtaposition  with  a  great 
tumbler  of  milk.  As  we  hear  that  Baltimore  does 
not  offer  many  attractions  to  a  casual  visitor,  we 
are  enjoying  a  quiet  morning.  I  can  quite  appreciate the  feeling  of  some  traveller  I  have  read 
of,  who  on  arriving  I  forget  where,  thanked  heaven 
there  was  nothing  to  be  seen.  In  a  hurried  journey 
one  gets  sadly  tired  of  lionising.  Besides  I  cannot 
but  feel  the  almost  impossibility  of  giving  any  original 
remarks,  or  of  telling  you  or  any  one  else  anything 
which  you  have  not  repeatedly  heard  before,  though 
may  be  in  varied  forms,  about  the  United  States. 
I  take  it  there  is  no  other  country  in  the  world 
that  has  been  so  often,  so  thoroughly,  and  so  well 
delineated  as  this,  not  even  Italy. 

Since  writing  the  above  we  have  been  out,  and 
I  am  sorry  to  say  there  is  more  to  see  than  I  anticipated. Joking  apart,  however,  there  are  some 
memorials  of  the  past  peculiarly  interesting  to  English 
people.  The  town  itself  is  pretty  nearly  what  I 
expected,  busy  and  commercial;  red-brick  houses, 
and  no  end  of  factories  and  smoke.  But  besides 
all  this  there  are  some  famous  monuments.  I  should 
mention  perhaps  that  Baltimore  is  called,  par  excellence, ""  the  monumental  city.""  First,  and  principally, there  is  a  very  fine  one  in  honour  of  Washington, a  Doric  column,  160  feet  high,  surmounted  by 
his  statue.  It  is  a  magnificent  structure,  and  I  think 
far  superior  to  that  in  the  city  of  Washington. 
Another,  called  Battle  Monument,  is  erected  to  the 
memory  of  the  defenders  of  the  city  in  that  same 
year,  1814,  when  the  English,  after  the  cruel  havoc 
they  had  made  at  Washington,  essayed  a  like  exploit 
here,  but  were  repulsed  after  bombarding  the  fort 
(Henry)  for  twenty-four  hours.  The  unfortunate 
General  Eoss,  who  commanded  the  English  land 
troops,  was  killed  in  the  melee,  and  the  fleet  (consisting of  sixteen  ships),  under  Admiral  Cochrane,  was 
also  compelled  to  retire.  The  third  and  last  trophy 
I  need  mention,  is  a  monument  in  honour  of  Colonel 
Armistead,  the  American  Commander,  and  is  in  the 
form  of  a  pyramid  made  with  cannon,  and  surmounted 
with  shot  and  shells.  I  forgot  to  tell  you  that  we  are 
located  at  a  hotel  yclept  ""  Barnums.""  I  am  quite 
curious  to  know  whether  the  proprietor  is  any  relation 
to  the  famous  manager  of  that  name.  We  purpose, 
for  a  change,  as  the  weather  is  so  fine,  leaving  here 
at  seven  this  evening,  taking  a  moonlight  flitting. 
The  train  ought  to  reach  Philadelphia  at  midnight, 
and  as  the  moon  is  now  about  the  full,  and  gloriously 
bright,  I  think  it  will  be  a  good  opportunity  of  seeing 
some  American  scenery  under  a  fresh  aspect.  .  .  . 
Nous  void  safely  deposited  in  the  very  middle  of  the 
Quaker  city,  at  the  Grirard  House,  a  most  magnificent 
looking  hotel  at  all  events.  The  nocturnal  journey 
turned  out  well,  and  as  I  expected,  the  beautiful 
moonlight  gave  a  romantic  tint  to  all  it  shone  upon, 
in  spite  of  the  prosy  squeaking  engine  and  the  lumbering cars.  The  passage  of  the  Eiver  Schuylkill 
(what  a  name !),  a  little  before  entering  the  town, 
was  an  especially  picturesque  incident.  Philadelphia 
is  generally  called  the  ""  prettiest  city  in  the  States,"" 
on  what  grounds  I  cannot  imagine,  unless  beauty  is 
supposed  to  consist  in  the  most  painfully  straight 
lines  and  acute  angles.  Judging  from  the  aspect 
of  the  town  in  this  morning's  perambulation,  I 
think  it  probable  I  should  expire  of  ennui  in  a 
week  if  forced  to  stay.  I  must  endeavour  to  describe 
its  general  appearance,  however,  in  order  that  you 
may  form  your  own  opinion,  as  may  be,  my  artistic 
dislike  to  extreme  regularity  renders  me  unduly  prejudiced. So,  first  of  all,  there  are  two  rivers :  the 
before-mentioned  unpronounceable  Schuylkill,  and 
the  Delaware.  Well,  nature  made  them,  so  they  are 
not  quite  straight.  The  city  is  built  between  them, 
and  I  cannot  liken  the  long  undeviating  rows  into 
which  the  streets  are  sliced,  to  anything  better  than 
the  bars  of  a  gridiron,  so  formal,  so  guiltless  of  a 
curve.  There  are  many  jokes  flying  about  at  the  expense  of  the  prim  and  precise  Philadelphians  ;  among 
others  it  is  said  that  owing  to  their  excessive  correctness they  object  to  resort  to  the  usual  and  more  simple formula  of  language  generally  employed,  but  that 
if  you  ask  your  way  of  a  passer-by,  you  will  be  directed to  take  the  third  turning  towards  the  east, 
thence  proceed  due  north,  whence  the  place  you  seek 
will  be  found  to  your  south-west.  Or  perchance  at 
dinner  you  may  be  requested  to  hand  the  pickled 
cucumbers  that  lie  on  the  south-east  of  the  stewed 
ham;  or  the  dish  of  Indian  corn  to  the  north-west  of 
the  pumpkin  pie ! 

There  are  several  squares  here  which  are  pretty 
enough,  and  like  most  of  these  enclosures  in  the 
towns  of  the  United  States,  tastefully  laid  out  with 
trees,  shrubs  and  walks.  Independence  Square  we 
especially  visited  as  being  the  spot  on  which  the 
American  declaration  of  Independence  was  proclaimed. The  room  in  the  State  Hquse  hard  by, 
where  the  document  was  finally  agreed  upon  and 
signed  on  the  memorable  4th  of  July,  is  still  left  as  it 
was  in  every  respect,  as  a  memento  of  the  deed.  On 
leaving  the  State  House  we  proceeded  to  the  Fairmount  waterworks,  a  pleasant  drive  of  about  three 
miles  from  the  town.  The  water  (to  the  amount  of 
22,000,000  gallons)  is  kept  in  four  reservoirs  on  the 
top  of  a  mount  or  mound  of  earth  1 00  feet  high,  to 
which  it  is  raised  by  mechanical  power  from  the  river 
beneath.  The  reservoirs  are  surrounded  and  the 
mount  intersected  with  gravel  walks  and  paths, 
shaded  by  chesnut  trees  and  evergreen  shrubs,  forming a  cool  and  agreeable  promenade  in  summer 
weather,  and  the  eminence,  though  slight  in  itself,  is 
sufficient  to  afford  a  good  and  extensive  view  both  of 
town  and  country,  all  being  so  flat  for  many  miles 
round.  The  cost  of  these  works  came  to  450,000 
dollars,  about  90,OOOL ;  and  I  was  told  that  upwards 
of  a  hundred  miles  of  iron  piping  is  used  in  conveying the  water  from  the  Fairmount  to  and  through  all 
the  various  quarters  of  the  city.  The  Grirard  College, 
to  which  our  steps  were  now  directed,  is  a  large  stone 
building,  on  the  model  of  the  Parthenon  at  Athens, 
but  it  is  a  poor  imitation  of  the  original  in  point  of 
architecture.  The  object  of  the  institution  is  a  most 
praiseworthy  one.  A  large  sum  of  money — I  believe 
200,000  dollars— was  left  to  the  city  of  Philadelphia 
by  a  Frenchman  of  the  name  of  Grirard,  for  the  purpose of  building  a  college  for  the  education  of  orphan 
boys.  The  pupils  are  received  between  the  ages  of 
eight  and  eighteen.  We  were  shown  all  over  the 
building,  as  well  as  the  grounds  and  gardens,  which 
are  extensive  and  handsome.  The  officials  were  particularly civil  and  good-natured  in  replying  to  all  our 
questions.  The  organisation  of  the  establishment  is 
carried  on  in  the  most  liberal  and  generous  scale,  and 
in  the   way  of  learning,   the   students   are   taught 
everything  they  may  wish  to  know. 

There  is  much  in  the  domestic  manners  and  customs in  this  country  to  which  I  find  it  impossible  to 
reconcile  myself.  When  will  the  people  learn  that 
they  may  be  free  and  independent  yet  at  the  same 
time  neither  coarse  nor  vulgar  ?  An  incident  occurred 
to-day  at  dinner,  at  which  I  cannot  help  laughing, 
though  I  was  excessively  irritated.  Among  other  singularities to  which  I  cannot  subscribe,  is  that  of 
rushing  in  at  the  sound  of  the  dinner-bell,  like  so 
many  wild  beasts  going  to  feed ;  and  then  when  they 
are  there,  the  way  they  bolt  everything,  seize  everything, and  heap  everything  eatable  on  their  plates  at 
once,  as  if  they  feared  their  neighbours  would  annex 
their  share.  I  was  walking  at  my  usual  pace  along 
the  dinner  room,  about  two  minutes  after  the  bell  had 
ceased  ringing,  and  looking  for  my  seat,  when  suddenly two  hands  (from  behind)  were  placed  on  iny 
shoulders,  and  the  voice  of  a  waiter,  with  the  most 
shocking  twang,  thus  addressed  me : — ""  Well,  Miss, 
I  calculate  if  you  want  victuals  you  had  better  go 
a-head!""  Altogether,  this  hotel  has  by  no  means 
tended  to  improve  my  impression  of  the  inhabitants 
of  this,  undeniably,  ""  first-rate  ""  country  (to  use  their 
own  favourite  expression).  At  night  we  had  another 
sample  of  their  equality,  and  for  the  first  time,  I  must 
observe  also,  I  found  a  want  of  the  usual  courtesy  to 
our  sex,  though  to  be  sure  the  offender  was  only  a 
boy.  On  reaching  our  bed-room  we  found  darkness 
instead  of  the  gas  we  expected,  and  we  had  omitted 
to  provide  or  indeed  think  of  bringing  a  light 
with  us.  We  rang  the  bell  and  asked  for  a  candle, 
when  our  waiter,  an  urchin  apparently  not  more 
than  thirteen  or  fourteen,  after  putting  his  arms  a-kimbo and  spitting  on  the  floor,  told  us  he  (t  guessed 
we  might  fetch  one  for  ourselves,  as  we  ought  to  have 
brought  one  up  with  us."" 

We  leave  Philadelphia  to-morrow ;  and  as  I  find  my 
letter  has  already  expanded  itself  considerably,  I  will 
defer  to  my  next  our  journey  to  New  York. 

Always,  &c. 

C. "
7,"New  York,  August  22nd. —  My  dear  Father,  —  We 
quitted  Philadelphia  early  in  the  morning  of  the  20th, 
that  is,  the  day  before  yesterday,  a  short  railway 
journey  of  about  sixty  miles  brought  us  to  Amboy,  not 
a  very  interesting  route  ;  the  country  flat  and  sandy. 
The  only  object  of  note  we  passed  was  at  Bordentown, 
where  the  house  and  grounds  formerly  occupied  by 
Joseph  Buonaparte  were  pointed  out  to  us.  Amboy 
is  situated  at  the  extremity  of  a  creek  or  arm  of  the 
sea  running  inland.  Here  we  left  the  cars  and  embarked in  a  steamer.  It  is  pleasant  to  be  able  to 
praise  something ;  so  as  to  make  up  for  all  the 
wrath  and  indignation  poured  forth  in  my  last  letter 
to  you  about  Philadelphia.  I  must  frankly  allow 
that  the  first  view  of  New  York  far  surpasses  in 
splendour  any  town  in  the  world  I  have  yet  seen, 
and  of  those  the  number  is  not  small.  Everything 
which  constitutes  either  magnificence  or  beauty 
seems  united  here.  Sea  and  river,  mountain  and 
garden,  houses,  ships,  trees,  all  seem  to  vie  with  each 
other  in  adding  to  the  charm  of  this  matchless  scene, 
coloured  too  as  it  was  by  the  light  of  the  setting  sun. 
I  can  scarcely  imagine  anything  more  beautiful  than 
the  view  which  burst  upon  us  as  we  gradually  approached the  entrance  to  the  harbour.  The  channel 
narrowing  and  disclosing  Staten  Island  with  its  green 
trees  and  bright-hued  gardens  on  the  one  side,  and 
the  fine  suburb  of  New  Jersey,  apparently  itself 
a  city  of  palaces  on  the  other.  It  is  said  that  the 
united  navies  of  the  whole  world  would  have  room  to 
float  in  the  New  York  waters.  Whether  this  may  be 
an  exaggeration  or  not  I  am  not  competent  to  decide  ; 
but  the  idea  of  great  space  and  vastness  must  strike 
the  most  casual  observer.  Judging  from  the  impressions of  the  first  four-and-twenty  hours,  I  am  inclined 
to  give  this  the  preference  over  any  of  the  towns 
I  have  yet  visited  in  the  States.  It  is  bustling  and 
noisy  to  be  sure ;  still  it  is  cheerful,  and  I  should 
think  agreeable  as  a  residence.  The  far-famed  and 
world-renowned  ""  Broadway,""  the  street  par  excellence of  New  York,  I  am  almost  afraid  to  mention. 
It  has  been  so  written  to  death  by  travellers  of  every 
kind,  still  it  is  unavoidable.  ""  Broadway ""  is  the 
""  Canebiere ""  *  of  New  York.  As  far  as  I  can  see 
at  present,  all  the  shops,  or  stores,  as  they  call  them, 
in  the  town,  seem  to  be  accumulated  here ;  as  well 
as  the  greater  number  of  the  hotels.  These  last- 
mentioned  establishments  are  almost  the  distinctive 
feature  of  the  place.  Public  or  national  buildings,  so 
to  speak,  exist  in  very  small  numbers ;  but  the  hotels 
are  magnificent  beyond  all  conception, —  palaces 
indeed  they  may  be  rather  called,  both  in  size  and 
redundancy  of  ornament.  They  are  for  the  most  part 
built  either  of  pure  white  marble  or  of  a  reddish- 
brown  granite,  the  latter  in  my  opinion  especially 
beautiful.  Attached  to  Broadway  towards  the  higher 
part  of  it  are  several  very  fine  streets  consisting 
entirely  of  private  houses.  These  streets  are  mostly 
called  ""  Avenues,""  and  are  numbered  ""  4th,  5th,"" 
&c.  They  are  chiefly  inhabited  by  the  ""  upper  ten 
thousand.""  ....  The  place  of  our  disembarcation  on  Saturday  presents  a  curious  example 
of  the  different  purposes  to  which  things  in  this 
world  may  be  applied.  The  spot  is  named  indifferently, the  Battery  or  the  Castle  Gardens,  and  one 
of  its  uses  is  that  of  a  general  landing-place  for 
voyagers  coming  from  or  going  to  the  south.  Being 
well  laid  out  in  shady  walks,  planted  with  trees 
and  shrubs,  it  forms  a  pleasant  rendezvous  where 
you  may  meet  your  friends.  Indeed,  it  is  the  only 
thing  of  the  kind  in  New  York,  bearing  the  remotest 
resemblance  to  one  of  our  parks.  But  besides  all 
this,  there  is  something  else,  and  at  night  the  scene 
changes — into  what  should  you  guess  ?  No  less  an 
institution  than  the  Italian  Opera !  called,  for  the 
nonce,  the  Castle  Garden  Theatre.  The  ancient 
name  of  Castle  G-arden  was  Castle  Clinton,  erected 
as  one  of  the  defences  of  the  harbour ;  but  as  time 
went  on  and  new  and  more  efficient  fortifications 
were  built,  this  was  turned  to  the  pacific  purpose 
of  a  place  of  public  amusement;  and  finally,  as  I 
have  said,  it  is  now  used  as  the  Italian  Opera  House. 
Not  feeling  by  any  means  fatigued,  we  went  there 
on  the  evening  of  our  arrival.  The  interior  is  quite 
different  from  the  general  notion  one  entertains  of 
an  Opera  House.  There  are  no  boxes  at  all;  the 
world  sits  in  what  we  should  call  the  pit ;  ladies  wear 
bonnets,  and  gentlemen  what  they  please.  Sontag* 
is  the  prima  donna  at  present,  and  took  the  part  of 
Kosina  in  the  Barbiere ;  but  either  she  is  not  in 
good  voice,  or  else  she  is  saving  it.  Knowing  her 
style  so  well  as  I  do,  I  could  see  there  was  something not  right.  She  gave  the  impression  of  a 
person  humming  or  trying  over  a  song  before  proceeding to  perform  it  properly  ...  I  now  resume my  letter  after  a  relache  of  two  or  three  days, 
employed  chiefly  in  reading  your  budget  from 
England.  We  have  been  to  church,  and  also  to  a  place 
of  musical  entertainment  called  Christy's  Minstrels ; 
the   former   I   should   not   mention,    but   that   the 
Divine  Service  took   place  at  Trinity   Church,   the 
principal  and  handsomest  church,  not  only  in  New 
York,  but  I  believe  I  might  add  in  the  United  States, 
which  are  sadly   deficient   in   church   architecture. 
There  is  nothing  whatever  in  any  of  the  American 
churches,  I  have  seen,  either  to  please  the  eye  or 
ear.     This  Trinity  is  Orothic,  spacious,  and  possesses 
a  very  high  steeple  ;  but  I  think  that  is  all.     Christy's 
Minstrels  are  amusing  enough.     They  are  a  set  of 
apparently  black  men,  numbering  from  twelve    to 
fourteen  persons,  and  who  impersonate  the  ""  darkies; "" 
talk  as  they  talk,   sing  as  they  sing,  and  play  the 
banjo,  bones  and  other  instruments.     They  perform 
alternately  solos,  duets,  trios  and  choruses.     Some  of 
the  airs  are  exceedingly  melodious,  and  the  words 
adapted  to  them  quite  pathetic.     Two  especially  I 
noted  are  most  touching  called  ""  Old  Dog  Tray,""  and 
""  My  old  Kentucky  Home,  (rood  Night.""  We  went  this 
afternoon  to  dine  with  Mr.  K.  the  banker,  to  whom 
I  had  a  letter  of  introduction.     His  country  residence is  at  Hoboken,  a  suburb  of  New  York  about 
five  miles  off.     The  scenery  on  the  way  was  beautiful  and   moreover  quite   wild.     It   is   difficult  to 
believe  that  so  large  a  city  is  close  at  hand,  one 
might  fancy  oneself  hundreds  of  miles  afar  in  the 
backwoods,  so  still  and  silent.     We  dined  with  Mrs. 
K.'s  family.     They  have  a  pretty  house  and  grounds, 
with  a  magnificent  view  from  their  garden,  of  New 
York  in  the  distance,  and  the  Hudson  flowing  at 
their  feet.  Mrs.  K.  and  the  daughters  are  hospitable, amiable  people,  with  lovely  faces  like  all  American women. 

N.B.  —  The  driver  missed  his  way  in  returning, 
and  we  did  not  get  back  till  late. "
8,"August  25th.  —  Set  out  last  evening  by  the  light  of 
a  bright  moon,  en  route  to  Niagara.  The  railroad  for 
some  distance  was  along  the  banks  of  the  Hudson, 
which  are  very  beautiful  by  day  and  may  be  called 
romantic  by  night.  I  intend,  if  all  be  well,  to 
return  to  New  York  by  boat  on  the  river,  and  thus 
to  see  the  beauties  of  the  road  by'  land  and  water. 
Reached  Niagara  early  this  morning  and  proceeded 
immediately  across  the  river  to  the  Clifton  House 
on  the  Canadian  side.  The  view  of  the  falls  being 
better  in  every  respect  here  than  on  the  American 
shore.  I  know  it  is  the  fashion  with  most  people 
to  go  almost  out  of  their  senses  on  the  first  view 
of  the  Niagara,  or  at  the  very  least  to  be  rendered 
speechless,  entranced,  and  what  not  at  the  first  introduction to  the  falls.  I  regret  to  be  obliged  to 
confess  that  no  such  violent  effect  has  been  produced on  my  hardened  nerves,  and  yet  I  do  think 
them  glorious,  and  though  not  astonished,  on  the  other 
hand,  I  am  not  disappointed.  There  is  one  peculiarity 
in  these  falls  which  is  unaccountable,  that  is,  that 
barring  the  noise,  you  can  form  a  perfectly  correct 
estimate  of  the  appearance  of  them  from  pictures, 
even  indifferent  ones.  This  is  very  singular,  as 
generally  speaking,  falling  water  is  precisely  the 
thing  painting  can  rarely  render  natural,  yet  in  this 
instance  there  is  an  exception.  The  American  Falls 
are  just  opposite  my  windows,  the  larger  one,  called 
.the  Horse-shoe,  a  little  further  on  in  the  distance. 
Took  a  short  walk  to  the  far-famed  Table-rock  in 
the  afternoon,  from  the  brink  of  which  the  Horseshoe Fall  is  seen  in  all  its  splendour. 

29th. — Crossed  to  the  American  side  by  a  suspension 
bridge  (something  like  the  one  at  Friburg,  but  not 
so  fine),  and  went  to  Groat  Island,  whence  we  saw 
the  rapids  to  perfection.  Then,  after  some  considerable clambering  and  climbing,  slipping  and 
sliding,  we  made  our  way  down  nearly  underneath 
the  American  Fall.  We  were  speedily  enveloped  in 
the  mist  and  spray,  and,  as  may  be  supposed,  nearly 
deafened  by  the  roar.  Having  sufficiently  gazed 
from  below,  we  proceeded  to  re-ascend  our  difficult 
path.  At  length  we  reached  the  summit,  and  then 
drove  along  the  shore  to  the  rapids.  A  little  round 
tower  like  a  lighthouse  has  been  constructed  in  the 
middle  of  the  river,  and  is  approached  by  means  of  a 
bridge  made  of  the  trunks  of  trees.  The  tower  is  built 
as  near  as  safety  will  allow  to  the  edge  of  the  cataract. 

30th. — Embarked  this  morning  in  a  steamer  bearing the  romantic  name  of  The  Maid  of  the  Mist. 
Her  travelling  experiences  have  been  few,  as  she  was 
built  on  the  spot.  She  takes  the  same  short  voyage 
three  times  every  day,  and  is  moored  for  the  night  at 
the  place  of  her  birth.  She  goes  bravely  through 
her  task  notwithstanding ;  passing  under  and  through 
the  torrent  and  mist  of  the  American  Falls,  and  as 
close  as  prudence  permits  to  the  Horse-shoe,  which  is 
by  no  means  so  placable  as  its  neighbour,  and 
obliges  one  to  keep  at  a  very  respectful  distance. 
What  has  charmed  me  most  in  our  excursion  to-day 
has  been  the  number  and  variety  of  rainbows  :  of  all 
hues  and  in  every  conceivable  spot  near  the  falls; 
now  arching  over  them,  now  dipping  under  them, 
now  shooting  across,  and  occasionally  forming  a  com- 
plete circle.  Spent  the  rest  of  the  morning  in  Groat 
Island,  a  delightful  lounging-place,  with  every  charm 
that  nature  can  give  around  you.  I  should  not 
greatly  object  to  pitching  my  tent  permanently  at 
Niagara.  We  reserve  for  this  afternoon  the  bouquet 
of  our  Niagara  expedition,  if  such  a  term  may  be 
used,  applied  to  water  as  well  as  fire-works.  It  consists in  what  is  called  going  under  the  Horse-shoe  Fall. 
Having  been  ushered  into  a  small  dressing-room,  we 
were  provided  with  the  costume  de  rigueur  on  such 
occasions :  a  pair  of  drawers  and  stockings  of  flannel, 
then  a  pair  oftrowsers  and  a  dress  of  bloomer  fashion, 
descending  only  to  the  knees,  both  made  of  india- 
rubber,  and  lastly,  a  covering  for  the  head  of  an  indescribable shape,  something  between  a  quakeress's 
bonnet  and  a  helmet.     Thus  elegantly  equipped  we 
started,  accompanied  by  four  guides.      Presently  we 
came  to  a  sort  of  shelf  or  ledge  cut  out  of  the  rock,  a 
most  slippery  place,  and  it  was  with  great  difficulty 
we  could  keep  our  footing.     Along  this  we  proceeded 
for  some  hundred   yards  or   thereabouts,   until   we 
found   ourselves  completely  underneath,  and  in  the 
hollow  of  the  arch  formed  by  the  leap  of  the  immense body  of  water  from  the  rock  above  us.     The 
scene  here  was  terrific,  and  rather  calculated  to  shake 
one's  courage.  The  noise  was  awful !  added  to  which, 
the  blinding  spray  from  the  whirlpool  boiling  and 
foaming  below  quite  frustrated  any  attempt  at  using 
our  eyes,  besides  finding  it  very  difficult  to  preserve 
our  equilibrium.     At  length  we  emerged  in  safety,  but 
drenched   to   the  skin,    notwithstanding   our  india- 
rubber  preservatives.  • 

3lst. — A  comparatively  idle  morning  passed  in 
my  favourite  nook  on  Groat  Island.  One  might 
dream  away  one's  existence  very  pleasantly  here. 
The  hand  of  man  has  fortunately  left  nature  alone 
in  her,  grandeur.  The  fine  forest  spreads  its  dark 
masses  far  and  wide  undisturbed,  and  above  all  unimproved by  mortal  touch.  The  stillness  which 
perhaps  might  otherwise  be  oppressive,  being  broken 
by  the  roar  of  the  falling  water,  and  the  fluttering  of 
innumerable  birds  of  a  most  brilliant  orange  colour, 
who  appear  to  have  chosen  this  spot  as  their  home. 
As  we  were  slowly  wending  our  way  back  to  the  Clifton House,  we  found  ourselves  in  the  midst  of  a  very 
unexpected  scene  of  excitement.  A  slave  had  escaped 
from  the  American  side  of  the  Niagara,  and  had 
already  swum  nearly  half-way  across ;  his  pursuers 
were  frantically  pushing  off  a  boat;  the  suspense 
then  became  painful,  I  have  hardly  yet  recovered  my 
breath ;  but  it  was  all  right  at  last,  though  a  narrow 
escape — the  fugitive  gained  the  Canadian  shore,  and 
he  was  safe.  I  could  not  find  out  whether  he  had  been 
guilty  of  anything  more  than  running  away.  Very 
probably  he  had,  and  I  have  not  the  slightest  doubt 
he  deserved  to  have  been  caught ;  still  my  sympathies 
are  always  with  the  hunted  and  not  with  the  hunters, 
under  any  circumstances.  After  dinner  we  took  a 
drive  to  the  village  of  Chipewa,  an  Indian  settlement 
on  the  banks  of  the  Niagara  Eiver,  and  also  the  scene 
of  one  of  the  many  fights  between  the  Americans  and 
ourselves  during  the  war.  It  is  now  a  quiet  thriving 
little  place,  where  the  Indians  bring  the  specimens  of 
their  handiwork  for  exhibition  and  sale  to  the  numerous visitors  constantly  passing  to  and  fro.  We 
made  several  purchases  of  them.  Their  embroidery 
is  exceedingly  pretty :  shoes,  card-cases,  boxes  made 
of  the  skin  and  worked  with  the  hair  of  the  Moose- 
deer,  ingeniously  dyed  to  the  required  tints  of  the 
flowers  or  fruit  it  is  worked  to  represent.  Also  they 
make  fans,  screens,  and  other  ornaments  of  eagles' 
feathers  in  a  most  admirable  manner. "
9,"September  2nd. — We  are  once  more  on  the  waste 
of  waters  :  out  of  sight  of  land,  somewhere  about  the 
middle  of  Lake  Ontario ;  so  before  we  leave  the 
steamer,  which  we  expect  to  do  to-night,  and  consequently will  have  fresh  matter  to  relate,  I  will  take 
up  the  thread  of  my  narrative  from  the  time  of 
leaving  Niagara.  You  will  have  observed  that  while 
there  I  adopted  the  diary  form,  wishing  to  note  down 
the  impressions  of  the  moment.  We  took  our  departure from  the  Clifton  House  yesterday  morning. 
A  drive  of  eight  miles  on  a  tram-road  brought  us  to 
Queenstown,  where  we  crossed  the  Niagara  by  means 
of  the  suspension  bridge,  to  Lewiston.  This  bridge  is 
said  to  be  the  largest  in  the  world,  but  it  does  not 
appear  to  me  to  be  so  wide  nor  so  high  as  that  at 
Friburg;  its  length  is  1040  feet.  From  the  heights 
above  this  town  a  most  charming  view  is  obtained  of 
the  valley  of  Niagara  and  Lake  Ontario.  Here,  too, 
there  was  a  very  sanguinary  engagement,  in  1812, 
between  the  United  States  and  British  forces,  in 
which  the  English  General,  Brock,  was  killed.  A 
column  has  been  erected  to  his  memory,  but  some 
years  ago  it  was  blown  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night 
by  some  envious  American.  A  good  deal  of  it  was 
destroyed,  and  it  looks  now  in  a  very  shattered  condition. Some  years  ago  there  was  an  attempt  made 
to  restore  it,  but  this  has  been  abandoned. — Apropos of  envy  and  jealousy,  I  forgot  to  mention  that 
while  at  Niagara  Falls,  during  one  of  our  excursions, 
the  spot  was  shown  to  us  where,  according  to  our 
guide,  one  of  the  ""  decisive  battles  of  the  world  ""  was 
fought,  and  at  which  I  need  not  say  the  English  were 
entirely  defeated. — Lundy's  Lane  was  the  name  of 
the  battle-field.  After  a  short  delay  at  Lewiston  we 
embarked  on  one  of  the  largest  and  most  magnificent 
steam-boats  imaginable  (whence  I  am  now  writing). 
It  resembles  a  floating  castle  more  than  a  ship,  with 
highly  ornamented  saloons  and  cabins  built  on  deck; 
the  roofs  of  these  again  being  carpeted  so  as  to  form 
a  place  for  walking;  the  whole  surmounted  by  an 
awning  during  the  sunshiny  hours.  A  little  before 
sunset  we  reached  Toronto.  Here  we  remained  some 
hours,  but  not  having  any  introductions  to  any  of  the 
inhabitants,  I  did  not  think  it  worth  while  to  land,  so 
contented  myself  with  its  external  appearance,  which 
is  very  handsome :  houses  and  streets  are  large  and 
well-built.  I  am  told  its  population  has  exactly 
doubled  itself  in  the  past  ten  years I 
have  just  met  with  a  curious  interruption,  which  I 
will  relate  whilst  the  recollection  of  it  is  fresh  on  my 
mind.  A  party  of  young  girls,  numbering  about  six 
or  seven,  walked  up  to  the  table  at  which  I  am  writing, and  after  a  moment's  pause  thus  addressed  me, 
""  Miss  !  Tell  me  now,  where  were  you  educated  ?"" 
I  certainly  have  seldom  been  more  taken  aback  than 
at  this  sudden  query,  for  I  feared  I  had  unintentionally offended  some  one,  though  in  what  way  I  was 
totally  ignorant.  However,  I  thought  the  simple  truth 
would  be  the  best  reply,  so  I  answered,  ""  Partly  in 
England,  partly  in  France.""  The  riddle  was  now 
soon  solved  :  it  appears  that  when  we  first  came  on 
board  yesterday,  they  heard  Eleanor  and  me  talking 
French  together,  as  we  very  frequently  do,  consequently we  were  set  down  as  French  ;  but  this  morning, on  finding  us  equally  familiar  with  the  English 
tongue,  they  determined  to  resolve  their  doubts  then 
and  there,  and  so  took  this  singular  method  of  doing 
so.  We  have  now  had  a  very  amicable  conversation, 
and  have  given  each  other  some  mutual  information 
about  the  manners  and  customs  of  our  respective 
countries.  They  are  travelling  in  a  party  of  eight,  and 
are  about  to  make  a  vacation  tour  in  Canada.  Though 
to  us  it  seems  strange,  it  is  quite  a  common  practice 
here  for  a  lot  of  school  girls  to  join  together  on  the 
breaking  up  of  the  colleges  and  schools,  and  make  a 
summer  holiday  trip  wherever  they  may  feel  inclined, 
and  unchaperoned  by  fathers,  mothers,  or  governesses. 
Last  night,  towards  twelve  o'clock,  there  appeared  a 
very  beautiful  aurora  borealis,  which  illuminated  the 
heavens  in  a  wondrous  manner.  We  are  just  now 
arriving  at  Kingston,  where  I  believe  there  will  be  a 
change  of  steam-boats  :  the  colossal  affair  we  are  now 
in  not  being  adapted  to  some  of  the  narrow  channels 
through  which  we  shall  have  to  thread  to-morrow. 
So  adieu  for  the  present :  my  next  will  probably  be 

from  Montreal. 

Always  your  affectionate 

C. 

Since  writing  the  above  I  find  we  are  to  anchor 
hefe  for  the  night,  and  take  the  other  steamer  to- 
morrow: plenty  of  daylight  being  necessary  during 
the  passage  of  the  St.  Lawrence. 


RIVER   ST.   LAWRENCE —THOUSAND   ISLES. "
10,"MY  DEAR  FATHER, — At  an  early  hour  of  the  morning 
after  our  arrival  at  Kingston  we  commenced  our  voyage down  the  river  St.  Lawrence.  In  about  a  couple 
of  hours  we  came  to  the  ""Thousand  Isles,""  a 
numerous  group  so  called,  among  which  we  threaded 
our  way  for  some  time.  These  islets  are  very  celebrated for  their  beauty,  though,  individually,  I 
should  call  them  more  curious  than  picturesque; 
moreover,  some  of  them  are  really  too  small  to  be 
dignified  by  the  name  of  islands,  being  merely  little 
beds  of  earth.  Indeed,  the  whole  collection  conveys 
the  idea  of  having  once  been  a  good-sized  piece  of 
land,  now  broken  into  a  number  of  small  portions 
and  tossed  into  the  water.  The  surrounding  scenery 
on  the  green  banks  of  the  St.  Lawrence  is,  however, 
very  pleasant  to  look  upon.  The  navigation  of  the 
rapids,  a  little  below  the  ""  Thousand  Isles,""  now  engaged our  attention.  They  are  very  dangerous,  and 
require,  even  in  a  steam-boat,  most  careful  management. The  river  rushes  along  most  furiously,  and  all 
around,  in  most  unpleasant  propinquity,  rise  huge 
rocks,  threatening  destruction  to  all  who  approach 
them,  and  against  any  one  of  which,  had  we  struck, 
we  must  have  gone  to  pieces  and  probably  perished  in 
a  moment.  We  fortunately,  however,  had  a  steady 
and  skilful  commander,  and  in  due  time  we  were 
clear  of  all  difficulties.  Near  these  rapids,  by  the 
bye,  is  laid  the  scene  of  the  famous  Canadian  boatsong,  ""  Eow,  brothers,  row.""  The  singers  were  in 
ancient  days  the  fur  traders  of  Montreal,  who  were  in 
the  habit  of  ascending  the  Ottawa  Eiver,  which  is 
just  above  these  rapids,  to  sell  their  goods  to  the  Indians. They  used  to  stop  at  a  church  on  an  island 
dedicated  to  Saint  Ann,  their  tutelary  saint,  and  offer 
their  orisons  to  her :  hence  the  allusion  you  will 
remember  in  the  song :  ""  We'll  raise  to  St.  Ann,""  &c. 
A  pleasant  sail  for  two  or  three  hours  more  brought 
us  to  Montreal,  the  first  impression  of  which  is  most 
agreeable.  I  was  quite  rejoiced  to  see  the  English 
flag  flying  once  more.  Not  that  it  can  be  compared 
in  point  of  beauty  to  the  stars  and  stripes ;  still  it  is 
more  comfortable  to  see  the  English  flag  where  you 
hear  the  English  tongue.  Having  established  ourselves in  the  best  quarters  we  could  find  at  Done- 
gana's  Hotel,  Montreal  being  at  present  very  crowded, 
we  proceeded  to  employ  the  remaining  hour  or  two 
of  daylight  in  reconnoitring  the  town  and  neighbourhood. The  scenery  I  find  remarkably  pretty,  and, 
moreover,  the  city  has  an  air  of  comfort,  and  to  a  certain extent  of  antiquity,  rarely  to  be  seen  in  the  States. 
We  drove  for  a  short  distance  along  the  base  of  the 
Montreal  Mountain,  as  it  is  called  par  excellence,  and 
then  made  the  ascent.  The  view  from  its  summit 
is  most  picturesque, — green  undulating  land  dotted 
with  country  houses  and  cottages,  with  beautiful  gardens and  trees.  This  morning  we  visited  the  Cathedral, and  one  or  two  other  churches,  but  they  are  in 
nowise  remarkable,  at  least  they  look  paltry  after  the 
splendour  of  the  Catholic  churches  in  Europe.  The 
scene  of  the  terrible  fire  which  occurred  here  three 
years  ago  was  pointed  out  to  us.  It  has  fearfully  devastated a  great  part  of  the  town.  It  seems  difficult 
to  understand  how  such  a  fire  could  have  lasted  so 
long  a  time  and  have  done  so  much  mischief,  as  the 
houses  were  not  built  of  wood,  which  I  had  always 
imagined  to  be  the  case  ;  yet  the  flames  raged  and 
raged  on  in  spite  of  every  effort,  and  for  some  time 
burst  forth  again  and  .again,  notwithstanding  several 
houses  being  blown  up  in  order  to  create  a  blank 
space  and  check  the  progress  of  the  conflagration. 
We  went  also  to  visit  a  convent  belonging  to  the 
order  of  Les  Sceurs  Grises.  There  are,  I  believe,  a 
great  number  of  religious  houses  of  this  description 
in  Montreal.  These  sisters  do  much  good  in  the 
town,  attending  the  sick,  comforting  the  unhappy, 
and  besides  they  take  a  number  of  children,  orphans, 
foundlings,  and  others,  whom  they  feed,  clothe,  and 
educate.  We  visited  the  various  rooms  and  saw  the 
children  at  their  different  occupations.  They  all 
looked  both  healthy  and  happy.  Having  seen  all 
that  was  worthy  of  especial  note  down  below,  including a  most  beautiful  and  wonderful  garden,  belonging to  a  Montreal  merchant,  whose  name  I  forget, 
but  who  has  collected  here  everything  which  is  rich 
and  rare,  in  shrub  or  flower,  we  proceeded  to  drive 
up  the  Mountain  again,  to  see  what  used  to  be  the 
governor  of  Canada's  country  residence,  but  which  is 
now  turned  into  a  sort  of  cafe  where  you  eat  ices, 
lunch,  &c.  The  house  is  handsome,  and  the  view  all 
round  exceedingly  fine.  Lord  Elgin  used  to  stay 
here  a  good  deal,  but  since  the  riots  which  took  place 
some  time  ago,  on  the  subject  of  the  Eebels  Indemnity Bill,  as  I  think  it  was  called,  the  seat  of  government has  been  transferred  to  Quebec ;  and  although 
Lord  E.  has  been  repeatedly  entreated  to  return  to 
Montreal,  he  has  refused.  I  hear  they  treated 
him  with  great  indignity  and  acted  very  disgracefully. Our  driver  gave  us  a  very  amusing  account of  the  proceedings  on  that  memorable  day. 
From  an  early  hour  in  the  morning  every  one  who 
possessed  any  eggs  was  waylaid,  and  their'eggs  bought 
for  whatever  they  chose  to  ask,  but  if  they  refused  to 
sell  they  were  taken  from  them  by  force ;  and  thus 
armed  they  awaited  Lord  Elgin's  sortie,  when  immediately  he  appeared  the  signal  was  given,  and  from 
far  and  near,  from  right  and  left,  from  above  and  below, came  the  shower  of  eggs.  Though  rather  ludicrous, after  all  it  was  excessively  insulting,  and  I 
don't  wonder  at  his  refusal  to  take  up  his  abode  with 
such  hosts.  '  The  grievance  complained  of  was,  that 
by  this  obnoxious  bill  the  innocent  and  loyal  subjects 
who  had  made  no  disturbance  were  taxed,  or  in  some 
way  made  to  pay,  for  repairing  the  damage  done  to 
property  by  the  insurgents.  This  does  seem  rather 
hard  certainly.  However,  I  am  only  able  to  relate 
one  side,  so  of  course  can  form  no  opinion  on  the  real 
merits  of  either.  The  chief  cause  of  complaint 
against  Lord  Elgin  was,  that  although  he  knew  how 
very  objectionable  and  unpopular  this  measure  was, 
he  did  not  even  try  to  throw  the  responsibility  off  his 
own  shoulders,  which  he  might  have  done,  by  sending 
it  to  England  for  approval,  but,  on  the  contrary,  took 
it  all  on  himself  and  signed  it.  We  returned,  shortly 
after  hearing  all  this,  to  our  hotel.  At  6  P.M.  we  left 
in  the  Countess  of  Elgin  steamer,  for  Quebec,  where 
we  landed  on  Sunday  morning,  4th  September.  The 
harbour  and  shipping  ;  the  old-fashioned  houses  clustered one  above  another  up  the  steep  hill-side ;  the 
beautiful  St.  Lawrence ;  and  lastly,  the  renowned 
heights  of  Abraham  frowning  above  all,  give  Quebec 
a  most  imposing  appearance.  Our  eyes  were  still 
further  gladdened  by  the  sight  of  red  coats  on  landing, 
and  our  ears  by  the  merry  sound  of  the  bugle  calling 
our  own  regiments  to  parade. 

Now  I  shall  despatch  this  at  once,  and  give  Quebec 
a  letter  to  itself:  till  when  good  bye. 

Ever  yours, 

C. "
11,"Russell's  Hotel,  Quebec,  September  5th.  —  My  dear 
Father, — If  I  remember  rightly,  my  last  letter  was 
closed  at  the  moment  of  our  arrival  at  Quebec.  With 
as  little  delay  as  possible,  our  time  of  sojourn  here 
being  limited,  we  commenced  making  acquaintance 
with  the  objects  of  interest  appertaining  to  the  place, 
and  of  these  the  first  chosen  was  the  scene  of  the 
battle,  of  course — the  gallant  attack  and  final  capture of  the  citadel  by  General  Wolfe.  The  ""  Heights 
of  Abraham  ""  is  a  singular  appellation,  but  I  can  find 
no  means  of  enlightenment  here  as  to  the  origin  of 
the  name.  There  is  a  fine  monument  erected  on  the 
spot  where  Wolfe  fell  (almost  in  the  moment  of 
victory),  but  it  is  sadly  defaced  by  the  relic-hunting 
people  who  have  come  here  at  different  times,  and 
who  have  actually  hewn  off  bits  of  the  stone  of 
which  it  is  composed  in  some  of  the  most  prominent 
places.  From  Cape  Diamond,  the  promontory  on 
which  the  citadel  is  built,  the  view  is  magnificent. 
The  St.  Lawrence  is  seen  winding  its  silvery  way 
through  forests  and  through  ravines  till  it  gradually 
fades  in  the  distance,  while  close  beneath  us,  ships  of 
all  nations,  some  in  movement,  some  riding  at  anchor, 
give  life  and  cheerfulness  to  the  scene.  On  leaving 
the  heights  to  descend  to  the  lower  world,  we  entered 
a  garden  attached  to  the  Government  house.  This  was 
once  private,  but  is  now  given  up  to  the  public  as  a 
sort  of  pleasure  ground.  There  stands  in  this  garden 
a  fine  pillar,  erected  to  the  memory  of  the  two  rival 
commanders  of  the  English  and  French  armies  during the  memorable  siege.  Singularly  enough,  they 
were  both  mortally  struck  almost  at  the  same  moment, 
although  Montcalm  survived  a  few  hours.  The 
monument  bears  an  inscription — short,  yet  eloquent, 
consisting  only  of  the  two  names  :  — ""  Wolfe,"" 
""  Montcalm,""  on  either  side.  On  quitting  the  gar- 
den, the  custode  presented  us  with  two  very  handsome bouquets  which  he  had  gathered  for  us  while 
we  were  moralising  over  the  memento  to  the  rival 
heroes.  Quebec,  the  old  part  of  it  at  least,  is  most 
irregularly  built;  the  houses  sometimes,  when  seen 
from  a  little  distance,  give  the  idea  of  being  piled  one 
upon  the  top  of  another ;  but  this  very  peculiarity 
renders  it  far  more  picturesque  than  the  newer  and 
more  irreproachably  precise  towns  we  have  travelled 
through  in  the  States.  There  are  two  cathedrals, 
one  Protestant,  the  other  Catholic,  and  no  end  of 
nunneries  and  sisterhoods  of  various  denominations. 
In  the  chapel  of  the  Ursuline  convent  Montcalm  is 
buried;  on  his  tomb  is  the  following  inscription: 
""  Honneur  a  Montcalm.  Le  destin  en  lui  derobant  la 
victoire  1'a  recompense  par  une  mort  glorieuse."" 
After  visiting  severally  the  above-mentioned  places, 
we  engaged  a  carriage  for  the  purpose  of  taking  us  to 
the  Falls  of  Montmorency,  which  we  reached  after  a 
drive  of  eight  miles  through  very  fine  scenery.  I 
was  both  astonished  and  delighted  with  this  waterfall, 
all  the  more  so,  perhaps,  that  I  had  heard  nothing 
about  it  beforehand.  Were  it  not  heresy  to  confess 
such  an  opinion,  I  am  not  sure  that  I  do  not  admire 
this  as  much  as  Niagara.  There  is  not,  indeed,  such 
an  immense  body  of  falling  water ;  but  then  the  height 
is  twice  as  great,  and  the  surrounding  scenery  is  far 
more  wild  and  romantic.  Byron's  description  of  the 
""Hell  of  Waters  ""  is  thoroughly  realised  here.  The 
falls  are  encircled  by  huge  black  rocks,  and  beyond 
them  nothing  but  the  wide  expanse  of  the  river. 

5th. — This  morning  was  ushered  in  by  a  frost, 
and  altogether  a  bitterly  cold  day, — quite  time  to  get 
back  to  the  tropics,  I  think.  We  went  after  breakfast to  see  the  great  stronghold  of  Quebec,  the  Citadel, but  with  the  exception  of  some  ""  lovely  soldiers"" 

as used  to  call  them,  and  a  tame  bear  belonging 

to  one  of  the  regiments,  there  was  nothing  to  detain 
or  attract  unprofessional,  that  is,  non-military  visitors ; 
besides,  we  were  nearly  blown  away  by  a  piercing 
east  wind.  We  purpose  leaving  here  this  evening  en 
route  to  the  South,  so  I  shall  probably  post  this  previous to  our  departure.  Quebec,  Montreal,  indeed  I 
may  say,  Canada  generally,  has  pleased  me  much. 
The  people  are  so  gentle,  civil,  and  above  all,  so 
polished  in  manner.  They  combine  a  good  deal  of 
the  old  French  school  of  thorough  politeness  with 
our  natural  characteristic  of  frankness,  without  rudeness. Few  amalgamations  can,  I  think,  be  more  really 
allied  to  perfection  than  this,  and  I  regret  leaving  it 
as  much  as  it  is  possible  (for  me,  at  least)  to  regret 
leaving  a  cold  severe  climate  for  a  more  genial  atmosphere  In  consequence  of  a  slight  accident 

which  occurred  to  some  part  of  the  steamer's  machinery, a  delay  of  some  hours  has  ensued.  We  shall 
soon  be  off  now,  however,  so  I  will  close  my  letter. 
This  night's  journey  will  only  be  retracing  our  steps 
as  far  as  Montreal. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 

C. "
12,"Albany,  September  1th. — You  will  see  by  the 
date  of  this,  my  dear  father,  that  we  are  now  considerably advanced  on  our  return  journey  to  New 
York,  hoping  to  reach  there  without  misadventure 
this  evening.  We  landed  at  Montreal  yesterday 
morning,  but  were  unfortunately  too  late  for  the 
fast  train;  our  progress  therefore  was  tedious  and 
fatiguing.  The  first  portion,  notwithstanding,  was 
not  unpleasant,  as  we  had  plenty  of  time  to  see  the 
different  places  through  which  we  passed,  and  also 
to  admire  the  scenery  of  Lake  Champlain,  on  the 
margin  of  which  our  route  lay  for  some  considerable 
distance,  till  we  reached  a  town  called  Burlington, 
a  busy  thriving  place,  and  apparently  a  central  point 
of  communication  by  land  and  water  to  all  parts. 
We  observed  several  fine  steamers  as  well  as  other 
vessels.  Had  the  weather  been  warmer  it  would 
doubtless  have  been  a  pleasanter  mode  of  travelling 
to  have  descended  the  lake  by  boat  instead  of  ""  car ; "" 
but  it  is  far  too  cold  for  aquatic  excursions  in  these 
northern  parts.  The  same  reason  will  prevent  our 
going  down  the  Hudson,  which,  as  I  said,  had  been 
our  previous  plan.  Soon  after  leaving  Burlington, 
the  night  began  to  close  in  upon  us,  and  the  most 
disagreeable  part  of  the  journey  ensued.  About 
two  o'clock  this  morning  we  arrived  at  a  village 
rejoicing  in  the  name  of  Eutland,  and  which  will 
long  remain  most  unfavourably  fixed  in  our  memory 
by  the  privations  we  had  to  endure.  It  should 
appear,  that  Rutland  is  one  of  the  places  subject  to 
the  operation  of  the  ""Maine  Liquor  Law;""  and  you 
may  judge  how  comfortable  it  was  to  be  informed 
that  the  only  refreshment  we  could  obtain,  hungry, 
cold,  and  weary  as  we  were,  was  their  horrid  iced 
water !  wine  not  being  permitted  to  enter  the  State 
(Vermont  I  believe  it  was) ;  and  the  fires  being  all 
out,  we  could  not  get  a  cup  of  tea  or  coffee !  In 
this  hospitable  region  we  were  condemned  to  remain 
for  upwards  of  two  hours,  getting  colder  and  colder 
with  the  approach  of  dawn !  At  length,  as  all 
things  must  have  an  end,  we  made  a  fresh  start ; 
and  in  course  of  time  stopped  at  Saratoga,  where  I 
must  do  people  the  justice  to  say  an  excellent  breakfast was  provided,  though  I  was  half  afraid,  after  the 
experience  of  the  past  night,  that  we  might  only 
be  offered  some  of  the  mineral  waters  for  which 
Saratoga  is  celebrated.  This  watering-place  is  the 
Baden-Baden  of  America.  All  the  grand  monde 
flock  here  in  the  season ;  some  to  drink  the  waters, 
some  to  dress,  some  to  flirt.  In  short,  the  nature 
of  these  spas  seems  to  be  morally  the  same  all  the 
world  over.  Saratoga,  or  rather  ""  The  Springs,""  which 
is  the  more  common  appellation,  being  now  deserted 
for  this  season,  most  of  the  hotels,  boarding-houses, 
&c.,  are  closed  until  next  summer.  The  next  station 
of  importance  we  came  to  bore  the  classic  name 
of  Troy,  but  as  we  only  remained  a  few  minutes  I 
cannot  tell  whether  it  deserves  so  high-sounding 
a  one ;  still  less  whether  there  are  any  grounds  for 
bestowing  the  respective  titles  of  Mount  Olympus 
and  Mount  Ida,  on  two  pieces  of  high  ground, 
scarcely  hills,  situated  on  the  northern  and  southern 
environs  of  the  town.  A  short  run  of  only  seven 
miles  brought  us  here,  the  prettiest  spot  (barring- 
New  York)  I  have  yet  seen  in  the  States,  built  on  the 
side  of  a  hill  bathed  by  the  river  Hudson.  Albany 
offers  a  most  commanding  appearance.  The  various 
public  buildings,  too,  are  constructed  and  placed  with 
equally  good  judgment  and  good  taste.  Of  these 
the  most  conspicuous  is  the  City  Hall,  almost  in  the 
centre  of  the  town,  the  dome  of  which  is  gilt,  consequently a  passing  sunbeam  falling  on  it  renders  it 
visible  at  a  great  distance.  I  am  sorry  our  time 
will  not  allow  us  more  than  this  superficial  view,  as 
we  doubtless  might  find  much  that  would  interest 
on  a  closer  examination.  Albany  received  its  name 
from  our  James  the  Second,  when  Duke  of  York 
and  Albany,  to  whom  a  grant  of  the  New  York 
territory  was  made  by  his  brother  Charles  after  his 
successful  contest  with  the  Dutch  in  1664.  .  .  . 
We  are  now  once  more  at  New  York,  having  resumed our  journey  from  Albany  half  an  hour  after 
the  above  lines  were  written.  Nothing  of  moment 
occurred  on  the  road  until  we  were  within  a  couple 
of  miles  of  our  destination,  when  we  had  the  misfortune to  run  against  a  horse  attached  to  a  cart 
imprudently  left  too  near  the  line  of  rails.  The 
poor  animal  was  killed  on  the  spot,  fortunately, 
in  a  moment,  but  it  was  a  shocking  sight  to  witness. 
.  .  .  .  I  regret  very  much  to  find  that  we  must 
relinquish  our  intended  visit  to  New  Orleans  and  the 
Mississippi.  This  is  a  great  disappointment.  I  had 
planned  it  all  so  well,  and  was  anticipating  a  most 
agreeable  expedition,  purposely  reserved  till  the  last, 
as,  from  all  I  have  heard,  it  is  the  best  worth  visiting 
of  all  the  wonders  of  the  United  States.  But  I'homme 
propose  et  Dieu  dispose.  The  yellow  fever  is  raging 
there  with  such  intensity  that  it  would  be  wickedness as  well  as  folly  to  make  the  attempt.  The 
latest  accounts  are  most  terrible.  The  devastation 
has  been  so  great  and  so  general  as  to  give  the  town 
the  appearance  of  a  city  of  the  dead.  Trade  and 
commerce,  even,  have  almost  ceased  temporarily.  As 
this  may  materially  alter  our  future  movements,  I 
shall  bring  this  letter  to  a  sudden  close  and  despatch 
it  by  to-morrow's  mail ;  but  you  may  expect  to 
hear  very  shortly  again,  informing  you  of  whatever 
fresh  projects  we  may  indulge  in.  Meanwhile  I  am 
ever  your  affectionate, 

C. "
13,"New  York,  September  12th.  —  My  dear  Father,  — 
Since  returning  from  our  Canadian  excursion,  we 
have  been  occupied  in  revisiting  the  principal  objects 
of  attraction  in  New  York,  besides  adding  some  to  our 
list  which  had  been  previously  omitted.  Strangers  here 
make  a  point  of  going  over  the  splendid  hotels,  just 
as  elsewhere  one  would  visit  the  churches,  or  in 
London  the  clubs.  To  these  last,  the  New  York 
hotels  bear  indeed  the  principal  resemblance.  The 
St.  Nicholas  is,  I  think,  the  finest  specimen :  its 
fapade  of  white  marble  beautifully  sculptured,  and 
the  interior  very  like  the  Reform  Club.  In  addition 
to  the  public  living  rooms  there  are  some  very 
magnificently  decorated  and  furnished  ' '  bridal  chambers ""  for  the  especial  benefit  of  newly  married  people 
who  may  have  the  moral  courage  to  go  and  spend 
their  honeymoon  en  evidence  before  all  the  world. 
But  I  believe  the  American  couples  do  not  make 
any  objection.  The  St.  Nicholas  is  no  less  than 
six  stories  high.  There  are  also  the  Metropolitan, 
the  New  York,  the  Astor  House,  and  Delmonico's,  all 
hotels  more  or  less  celebrated.  We  found  Taylor's, 
a  fine  establishment  on  the  principle  of  the  Parisian 
Restaurants,  to  be  very  well  worth  a  visit.  The 
saloon  where  you  dine  or  sup  is  scarcely  inferior  to 
""  Les  trois  Freres  ""  in  magnificence  and  decoration, 
though,  by  a  curious  singularity  of  taste,  it  is  subterranean. We  went  with  our  friends  the  D.'s  the 
night  before  last  to  supper  there,  and  had  a  most 
excellent  repast.  Some  of  the  most  appreciated 
specimens  of  the  New  York  cuisine  were  ordered, 
so  that  we  might  know  what  was  considered  best. 
Fish  they  cook  in  great  perfection ;  oysters  especially, they  dress  in  innumerable  ways.  Two  dishes 
I  remarked  as  particularly  worthy  of  commendation, 
were  woodcocks  stewed  with  truffles  and  ecrevisses, 
and  ham  boiled  in  champagne.  Previously  to  this 
supper  party  we  had  been  to  Christy's  and  heard 
some  new  songs.  One  I  must  tell  you  all  about ;  the 
enthusiastic  manner  in  which  it  was  received,  showing pretty  plainly  what  Mrs.  Beecher  Stowe  may 
expect  if  she  returns  to  her  ""am  countrie.""  The 
song  purported  to  be  concerning  some  one  called 
""  Aunt  Sarah ;  ""  but  was  evidently  directed  to  her. 
The  first  line  I  could  not  catch,  but  apostrophising 
Aunt  Sarah  it  continued  thus  :  — 
""  Go  talk  against  your  country  ! 
Put  money  in  your  purse ! 
But  when  the  happy  'Darkie' 
You  mention  in  your  prayer, 
Just  don't  forget  the  white  slave 
That's  starving  over  there ! "" 

I  never  heard  such  a  cheer  in  my  life  as  burst  forth 
at  these  words ;  it  was  positively  terrific.  I  should 
not  like  to  be  in  Mrs.  S.'s  place  if  she  were  to  come 
back  before  her  country  people  have  time  to  cool 
down.  They  seem  inclined  to  make  her  pay  rather 
dearly  for  what  she  has  written ;  but,  from  all  I  can 
gather  at  present,  the  Americans,  and  especially  the 
American  women,  are  annoyed  that  a  party  of  English 
women,  including  members  of  our  aristocracy,  should 
have  (to  speak  plainly),  without  knowing  what  they 
were  talking  about,  issued  a  sort  of  manifesto  containing a  number  of  positive  errors  in  point  of  fact, 
and  arguing  upon  premises  and  assumptions  which 
did  not  exist.  So  say  the  people  here,  at  least ;  for 
my  part,  I  know  nothing  of  the  matter,  pour  ou 
contre,  beyond  trying,  but  unsuccessfully,  to  wade 
through  ""  Uncle  Tom/'  by  which  I  obtained  as  much, 
or  rather  more,  information  on  the  subject  than  I  required. .  .  .  Yesterday  we  paid  a  visit  to  the 
Croton  Waterworks,  a  wonderful  monument  of  human 
industry.  The  great  reservoir  is  said  to  be  five  miles 
long,  and  is  able  to  contain  five  million  gallons  of 
water.  This  being  forty  miles  off  we  did  not  see,  but 
contented  ourselves  with  the  more  easily  attained 
portion  of  the  works  where  the  aqueduct  crosses  the 
Harlem  Kiver,  at  a  distance  of  about  eight  miles. 
This  spot  is  called  the  High  Bridge,  and  well  merits 
the  slight  trouble  of  the  excursion.  The  view  is  fine, 
I  should  think,  under  all  circumstances,  but  especially now  that  the  trees  are  beginning  to  wear  their 
autumnal  tints;  the  hues  are  so  dazzling,  so  rich,  so 
varied,  that  I  must  renounce,  as  hopeless,  any  effort 
at  description,  for  I  am  sure  you  would  accuse  me  of 
exaggeration.  For  my  own  part,  were  I  to  see,  or 
rather  to  have  seen,  such  colours  transferred  to  canvass, I  should  have  unhesitatingly  exclaimed,  ""  That  is 
unnatural !  ""  I  must  not  forget  to  notice  in  this  chronicle of  things  new  and  strange  the  steam  ferry-boats 
which  we  have  now  used  on  several  occasions,  in  the 
course  of  our  excursions  to  the  various  environs  of  the 
city :  viz.,  New  Jersey,  Brooklyn,  Staten  Island,  &c. 
Their  appearance  is  that  of  a  little  floating  town. 
Seen  at  a  short  distance,  one  might  fancy  a  block  of 
houses  had  detached  itself  from  the  remainder  of  the 
street,  and  gone  for  an  aquatic  promenade,  accom- 
panied by  all  the  men,  women,  children,  horses,  carriages, carts,  pigs,  dogs,  baskets,  and  wheelbarrows  it 
could  find  on  the  way.  A  voyage  in  one  of  these 
monster  conveyances  is  one  of  the  most  amusing 
incidents  in  the  New  York  life,  at  least  to  a  stranger. 
We  have  paid  several  visits  to  the  Great  Exhibition 
which  has  been  opened  here  in  imitation  of  the  London building.  This  too  is  chiefly  of  glass.  It  is 
in  a  circular  form,  but  much  smaller  and  every  way 
inferior  to  ours.  It  is,  however,  a  very  good  bazaar, 
but  that  is  all ;  moreover,  I  am  informed  it  is  a  mere 
private  speculation,  and  that,  consequently,  the  President was  rather  embarrassed  at  finding  Lord  Ellesmere  was  sent  on  behalf  of  our  Queen. 

This  is  our  last  day  at  New  York.  We  are  to  sail 
to-morrow,  bound  for  Mexico,  as  the  few  hurried  lines 
I  last  wrote  will  have  informed  you ;  I  will  have  a 
letter  all  prepared  to  despatch  from  Havana,  giving 
you  the  latest  intelligence.  Till  then  adieu. 
Your  ever  affectionate, 

C. "
14,"New  York  (Astor  House),  September  16th. —  My 
dear  Father, — Behold  us  here  still,  in  spite  of  all  our 
anticipatipns  to  the  contrary.  A  most  untoward  accident has  occurred.  We  proceeded,  according  to  arrangement, on  the  morning  of  the  13th,  to  the  quay  of 
embarkation,  having  taken  our  berths  in  the  Crescent 
City,  bound  for  Havana.  On  reaching  the  pier  with 
our  luggage  and  all  prepared  for  the  voyage,  we  were 
very  coolly  told  that  the  Crescent  City  had  taken  her 
departure  for  California  the  night  before !  It  appears 
that  the  Georgia  (another  of  the  same  Company's 
vessels),  which  had  started  for  California  some  days 
previously,  broke  down  when  off  Cape  Hatteras ;  the 
Crescent  City  being  the  only  other  boat  ready,  she 
was  sent  to  the  assistance  of  the  Georgia  and  her 
passengers,  and  we  poor  unfortunate  mortals  were 
plantes  la.  After  a  long  delay  and  an  immense  deal 
of  talking,  they  at  last  promised  to  forward  us  by 
another  boat  called  the  George  Law,  though  not  before this  (the  16th),  and  at  night,  for  the  very  unsatisfactory  reason  that  this  vessel,  the  George  Law,  is 
not  yet  quite  finished !  All  this  is  exceedingly 
vexatious,  for,  among  other  consequences,  this  delay 
may  make  us  too  late  for  the  English  steamer  due  at 
Havana  on  the  24th,  in  which  event  farewell  to  our 
contemplated  trip  to  Mexico. 

7  o'clock,  P.M. — We  are  off  at  last "
15,"Vera  Cruz,  September  28th. —  At  length  we  have 
safely  passed  the  dangers  and  overcome  the  delays  of 
our  voyage,  and  have  landed  here  all  well  this  morning. Nearly  the  whole  of  the  first  part  of  our  progress after  leaving  New  York  consisted,  however,  of 
a  series  of  disasters  and  discomforts  ;  and  although  we 
fortunately  reached  Havana  in  time  to  catch  the  Mexican mail,  we  nevertheless  took  eight  days  in  accomplishing what  is  usually  done  in  four,  namely,  the 
passage  between  the  two  ports. 

As  I  before  mentioned,  the  vessel  was  in  a  very 
unfinished  condition,  and  among  the  minor  evils  we 
had  to  endure  was  the  sticking  to  everything  we 
touched,  the  paint  and  varnish  being  quite  fresh : 
then  in  the  hurry  of  departure  they  had  forgotten  to 
provide  lamps  to  light  either  the  saloon  or  cabins,  so 
at  sunset  we  were  obliged  to  turn  into  our  berths, 
until  the  weather  getting  warmer  as  we  approached 
Havana  enabled  us  to  stay  on  deck  at  night.  Last 
and  worst  of  all,  when  we  had  been  at  sea  barely 
two  days  we  were  alarmed  in  the  middle  of  the  night 
by  the  vessel  suddenly  coining  to  a  dead  stop.  Soon  one 
passenger  after  another  stole  up  to  inquire  what  had 
happened,  but  did  not  come  down  again ;  so,  to  end 
this  state  of  suspense,  I  dressed  myself  as  well  as  I 
could  in  the  dark  and  went  on  deck.  All  the  information I  could  get  from  the  captain,  who  was  in  a 
shockingly  bad  humour,  was  that  something,  I  forget 
what,  had  burst,  but  there  was  no  danger,  ""  if  the 
weather  kept  calm.""  This  was  anything  but  pleasant 
intelligence ;  luckily,  however,  the  calm  continued, 
and  with  our  disabled  engine  we  reached  Havana  at 
length,  as  I  have  said,  in  seven  days  more.  Since 
the  accident  we  proceeded,  I  am  informed,  at  the  rate 
of  three  knots  an  hour  only.  We  had  no  sails  either, 
that  part  of  the  ""  fixings,""  like  many  others,  not  being 
completed.  But  from  Havana  I  am  glad  to  say  all 
has  gone  prosperously.  A  sunny  sky  and  a  calm  sea. 
We  passed  in  safety  the  famous  fi  Alacranes,""  Anglice 
""  Scorpions,""  a  dangerous  reef  of  rocks  so  called  ;  the 
terror  of  all  sea-going  people  in  these  parts.  Besides 
the  ordinary  danger  of  being  driven  upon  them  in 
stormy  weather,  there  is  the  additional  peril  of  a  current so  strong  as  to  render  it  excessively  difficult, 
under  the  most  favourable  circumstances,  to  keep  a 
correct  ""reckoning,""  as  I  believe  it  is  nautically 
termed,  consequently  many  have  been  the  ships 
drawn  to  their  destruction.  Even  steamers  do  not 
escape  sometimes :  within  the  last  ten  years,  two  of 
the  West  India  packets  have  been  wrecked  on  the 
Alacranes.  Before  casting  anchor  in  the  bay  of  Yera 
Cruz  we  passed  the  famous  castle  and  fortress  of  St. 
Jean  d'Ulloa.  It  seems  much  the  worse  for  the  siege 
by  the  Prince  de  Joinville  in  1838.  The  country  has 
been  also  in  too  disturbed  a  state,  apparently,  to 
allow  of  reparations  being  made.  Landed  at  nine 
o'clock,  and  in  consequence  of  the  English  consul 
having  written  a  very  civil  note,  putting  himself  and 
all  he  possessed  at  my  disposition,  we  went  at  once  to 
his  house  and  were  received  most  cordially.  Found 
a  large  budget  of  letters  from  England  awaiting  us, 
and  after  having  perused  them  and  made  necessary 
inquiries  concerning  the  ways  and  means  of  journeying to  Mexico  from  here,  we  went  to  the  Hotel  de  las 
Diligencias,  where  we  shall  remain  until  to-morrow 
afternoon.  I  am  rather  agreeably  surprised  with 
the  general  appearance  of  Vera  Cruz,  having  heard  it 
described  as  a  ""  hole  ;""  in  short,  as 'everything  that  was 
bad,  whereas  I  find  it  anything  but  dirty,  and  tolerably wide  streets,  and  by  no  means  offensive  looking, 
rather  the  contrary.  It  has  a  look  of  antiquity,  and,  to  a 
certain  degree,  of  sadness,  but  that  rather  adds  to  the 
interest  of  its  aspect.  The  first  peculiarity  I  observed 
was  a  crowd  of  vultures,  called  here  ""  Sopilotes."" 
They  hover  about  in  all  directions,  looking  for  prey, 
anything  dead  which  may  fall  in  their  way.  They 
are  melancholy  looking  creatures,  but  quite  tame. 
Apropos  of  beasts  of  prey ;  just  before  landing  to-day, 
we  amused  ourselves  in  watching  the  manoeuvres  of 
a  shark  who  kept  swimming  all  round  us,  apparently 
in  the  hope  of  catching  something  good  for  his  breakfast. I  fear  he  was  disappointed  in  his  expectations, 
as,  With  the  exception  of  a  small  piece  of  dry  bread 
which  the  cook  had  thrown  at  him)  there  was  nothing 
to  satisfy  his  craving.  At  three  o'clock  we  dined  and 
had  our  first  experience  of  Mexican  cookery.  The 
dishes  are  rather  strongly  seasoned  with  chilis,  peppers, &c.,  but  no  doubt,  when  once  accustomed  to  the 
cuisine  I  shall  find  it  by  no  means  bad.  The  sauces 
are  excellent,  and  very  scientifically  mixed.  Took  a 
walk  this  evening  with  the  young  son  of  the  English 
consul,  who  good-naturedly  volunteered  to  be  our 
cicerone.  We  directed  our  steps  first  to  the  Alameda, 
a  name  given  generally  to  the  public  promenades  in 
Mexico.  The  scene  here  was  very  pretty,  and  with 
the  adjuncts  of  a  setting  sun,  a  clear  bright  sky,  and 
an  old  ruined  castle,  was  almost  romantic.  To-morrow 
we  start  on  our  adventurous  journey.  I  wonder  what 
will  become  of  us  between  this  and  Mexico.  We  hear 
wonderful  tales  of  robbery,  but  we  must  hope  for  the 
best.  So  now  farewell  for  the  present. 

Your  ever  affectionate,

16,"Jalapa,  September  30th.~ -My  dear  Father, —  We 
arrived  here  at  5  o'clock  this  afternoon,  nine  hours 
after  our  time ;  but  the  wonder  seems  to  me  that  we 
are  here  at  all.  Such  roads !  or  rather  such  a  want 
of  them.  The  old  adage  came  to  my  recollection, 
""  If  you'd  seen  these  roads  before  they  were  made,"" 
&c.  But  we  have  seen  these.  It  is  perfectly  incomprehensible to  me  how  any  carriages  built  by  mortal 
hands  could  bear  even  one  of  the  fearful  knocks,  or 
rather  I  should  say,  leaps,  of  which  we  have  been 
suffering  a  succession  to-day  and  last  night.  We  had 
generally  eight  horses  or  mules  drawing  us,  and  I  do 
not  think  I  am  exaggerating  when  I  say  that,  during 
the  nineteen  hours  we  have  been  on  the  road,  we 
have  not  passed  over  100  yards  of  level  ground; 
stones,  holes,  rocks,  sand-banks,  chasms  both  wide 
and  deep — over  all  of  which  we  made  a  succession  of 
leaps.  In  short,  I  am  almost  too  much  bruised  and 
shaken  to  describe  our  progress :  if  this  continues,  I 
don't  think  we  shall  have  a  whole  bone  left  in  our 
bodies.  To  mend  matters,  we  had  to  get  out  of  the 
diligence  two  or  three  times  in  the  middle  of  the 
night,  and  walk  some  distance  through  the  mud  and 
in  the  dark,  so  as  to  lighten  the  conveyance  sufficiently to  enable  it  to  take  a  kind  of  flying  leap  over 
some  unusually  wide  chasm  in  the  road.  Apart  from 
these  grievances,  however,  and  when  we  could  manage 
to  keep  ourselves  still  for  a  few  minutes  at  a  time, 
and  look  around  us,  the  scenery  was  most  lovely, 
and  the  approach  to  Jalapa  will  never  be  effaced  from 
my  recollection.  How  nature  has  showered  every 
beauty  and  every  blessing  on  this  land !  I  have  read 
in  fairy  tales,  and  in  descriptions  of  what  Paradise 
was  supposed  to  be,  of  scenes  something  like  this  ; 
but  that  such  places  really  existed  on  the  earth 
I  could  not  have  believed  unless  I  had  come  here. 

October  1st. — We  slept  last  night  at  Jalapa,  being 
far  too  much  tired  to  attempt  continuing  our  route, 
so  shall  wait  and  take  our  chance  of  finding  vacant 
places  in  the  carriage  to-day.  Eeceived  a  visit  from 
Mr.  Kennedy,  an  English  gentleman  living  here,  and 
to  whom  I  had  a  le'tter  of  introduction,  and  who  is 
to  show  us  all  the  beauties  of  Jalapa  if  we  should 
not  leave  this  afternoon.  Meanwhile,  as  I  was  writing the  above,  I  was  interrupted  by  the  diligence 
dashing  or  rather  leaping  up  to  the  door,  and  finding 
that  there  were  two  vacant  places  we  were  soon  again 
en  route.  As  we  advanced,  the  scenery  was,  if  possible,  even  more  enchanting  than  on  the  other  side  of 
Jalapa.  The  most  distinguishing  feature,  at  least,  so 
it  appears  to  me,  is  the  profusion — the  wilderness  of 
flowers  spread  on  every  side.  The  ground  is  literally 
enamelled  with  them,  and  every  tree  and  shrub 
loaded  with  the  most  beautiful  and  brilliant  hued 
parasites  clinging  and  creeping  to  the  topmost  boughs 
of  even  the  highest  trees.  So  dazzling  an  array  of 
colours  I  never  saw  grouped  together —  crimson,  scarlet, blue,  orange,  purple,  of  all  forms  and  sizes,  and 
last,  though  not  least  in  loveliness,  the  pure  white 
blossoms  of  the  datura,  the  most  ordinary  of  wild 
flowers  here,  and  named  ""El  Floripundio.""  The 
snowy  peak  of  Orizava,  which  we  had  constantly  in 
sight  yesterday,  was  now  hidden  from  our  view.  I 
believe  the  next  mountain  of  importance  we  shall 
make  acquaintance  with  will  be  the  Cofre  de  Perote, 
about  half  way  between  Vera  Cruz  and  Mexico. 

October  4;th,  Hotel  San  Augustin,  Mexico. — We 
reached  here  yesterday  at  4  P.M.,  after  several  hairbreadth escapes  and  adventures  which  I  shall  now 
try  to  record  ;  but  the  constant  travelling  and  excessive fatigue  quite  prevented  me  writing  daily  since 
quitting  Jalapa.  On  that  same  night,  the  1st  October, got  to  Perote  about  11  o'clock,  a  dismal-looking 
place,  and  where  we  had  to  sleep  almost  in  a  stable 
yard — that  is,  our  bed-room  was  only  separated  by 
means  of  a  glass  door  from  the  various  denizens  of 
the  stable  and  farm.  The  sleeping,  however,  was 
but  nominal,  as  we  were  aroused  again  at  three  in 
the  morning,  and  tired,  cold,  and  exhausted,  with 
sleepy  companions  and  a  lowering  sky  we  set  forth 
on  our  night  march.  The  only  satisfactory  reflexion 
we  enjoyed  being,  that  we  were  provided  with  an 
armed  escort ;  as  soon  as  daylight  appeared,  however, 
they  left  us. "
17,"October  2nd. — This  day's  journey  was  very  tedious  and 
wearying,  an  almost  constant  ascent.  The  air  becoming colder  and  colder,  the  country  arid  and  sandy. 
The  flowers  had  left  us,  and  in  their  stead  there  was 
little  to  be  seen  save  some  dwarf  pines  and  patches 
of  brushwood  here  and  there,  but  all  the  rest  a  sandy 
waste.  Above  all  loomed  the  black  and  gloomy 
Cofre  de  Perote,  so  named  from  the  summit  of  the 
mountain  being  shaped  like  a  box  or  chest,  for  which 
""  Cofre  ""  is  the  Spanish  word.  Towards  the  end  of 
the  day,  however,  matters  began  again  to  improve, 
and  I  have  no  doubt,  if  we  had  been  able  to  distinguish the  scenery,  we  should  have  been  better  pleased; 
but  it  was  seven  o'clock  when  we  reached  Puebla,  and 
very  nearly  dark.  There  we  enjoyed  a  refreshing 
night's  rest,  preceded  by  an  excellent  supper.  We 
were  offered,  among  other  dishes,  some  very  nice 
preserve,  called  Cabella  de  Angel,  or  Angel's  hair, 
a  fanciful  and  pretty  name.  It  has  the  appearance 
of  long  golden  threads,  and  tastes  like  crystallised 
sugar.  I  could  not  make  out  of  what  it  was  made. 
At  a  little  village  on  our  road  to  day,  we  had  for  the 
first  time  some  pulque,  the  national  and  favourite 
drink  of  the  Mexicans.  It  is  most  abominable  both 
in  scent  and  taste ;  yet  it  is  said,  that  although  the 
first  impression  with  every  one  is  the  same,  that 
nevertheless  in  a  very  short  time  you  not  only  get 
accustomed  to  it,  but  become  most  inordinately  fond 
of  it.  This  may  be  so,  but  I  do  not  think  we  shall 
be  long  enough  in  Mexico  to  acquire  the  taste. 
""  Pulque ""  is  made,  I  believe,  from  the  flower  of 
the  maguey  plant,  a  sort  of  large  aloe,  which  grows 
in  profusion  all  over  the  country.  Hedges  and 
fences  are  here  made  by  nature,  both  of  the  maguey 
and  the  prickly  pear.  The  latter  is  generally  called 
by  its  Indian  name,  ""Nopal,""  and  is  used  as  the 
national  emblem  on  the  coins,  like  our  rose,  thistle, 
and  shamrock.  We  must  hope  for  an  opportunity 
of  seeing  Puebla  on  our  return,  as  this  time,  having 
arrived  after  dark  and  started  before  four  in  the 
morning,  we  were  unable  to  judge  of  its  appearance. 
In  point  of  size  and  population  it  is  the  next  to  Mexico. 
Yesterday,  though  the  last  day  of  our  journey  hither, 
was  the  most  fertile  in  adventure.  First  of  all,  we 
had  to  pass  through  the  ""  robbers'  tract ""  of  country, 
and  were  for  some  hours  in  momentary  expectation 
of  being  attacked.  The  spot  chosen  by  these  heroes 
for  their  depredations  is  singularly  well  adapted  for 
the  purpose ;  a  dark  thick  wood  concealing  two  deep 
ravines  on  either  side,  rocks  and  caves  in  all  directions, afford  excellent  ground  for  ambuscade  and 
sudden  attacks  on  the  unwary.  This  part  of  the 
country  is  very  appropriately  named  the  ""  Black 
Hole.""  We  were  fortunately,  however,  quittes 
pour  la  peur,  and  saw  no  living  robber.  But  about 
three  miles  after  leaving  Eio  Frio,  a  small  village 
.where  we  had  stopped  to  breakfast,  we  were  horrified 
at  passing,  within  a  distance  of  half  a  yard,  the  body 
of  a  man  hung  to  the  branches  of  a  tree  by  a  cord 
passed  round  his  waist.  The  upper  part  of  his 
body  was  naked  and  much  stained  with  blood,  apparently recently  shed.  It  was  a  shocking  spectacle, but  what  his  history  was  we  had  yet  to  learn. 
On  reaching  Mexico  in  the  evening,  we  heard 
to  our  consternation  that  the  diligence,  which 
left  Vera  Cruz  the  day  before  us  (and  in  which  I  was 
rather  vexed  at  not  being  able  to  secure  places),  had 
been  robbed  on  the  road,  and  everything  taken  from 
the  passengers.  A  young  man,  Mr.  Buchanan,  one 
of  our  fellow  voyagers  in  the  Avon  to  Vera  Cruz, 
begged  the  bandits  to  let  him  keep  his  desk,  after 
they  should  have  convinced  themselves  that  it  contained nothing  but  private  papers  of  his  own, 
and  of  no  use  to  any  one  else.  The  man  of  whom 
he  asked  this  favour  consented,  and  was  about  to 
give  him  back  his  desk,  when  one  of  the  robbers 
demurred,  and  insisted  on  taking  it.  It  was  this 
very  man  who  was  shot,  and  whose  body  we  saw 
hanging  to  the  tree.  It  appeared  that  the  diligence, having  met  a  party  of  soldiers  soon  after  their 
attack,  told  them  what  had  occurred,  and  on  which 
they  had  immediately  proceeded  to  the  scene  of 
action.  Before  long  they  overtook  the  gang,  shot 
one  dead,  as  it  happened,  he  who  had  the  desk  in 
his  hands,  and  wounded  two  of  the  others.  They 
hung  up  the  dead  man  at  once  to  a  tree,  as  a 
warning.  All  robbers  now  caught  are  instantly 
shot  without  trial,  and  their  bodies  hung  up  in 
terrorem  as  a  warning  to  others.  This  is  Santa 
Anna's  last  edict.  A  dreadfully  severe  one,  certainly, 
and  yet  it  seems  impossible  to  remedy  the  evil. 
The  constant  revolutions  and  changes  of  government 
in  this  distracted  country  have  the  effect  of  rendering the  law  a  dead  letter.  To  turn  from  this 
unpleasant  theme,  I  must  note  down  some  observations on  the  world-famed  valley  of  Mexico,  as  the 
view  of  it  bursts,  or  ought  to  burst,  on  the  sight  on 
attaining  the  heights  ""  about  forty  miles  from  the 
city.  After  traversing  many  miles  of  unceasing  toil, 
jumps,  jolts,  and  leaps,  we  at  length  gained  the  long- 
wished  for  eminence  whence  Mexico  in  all  her  glory 
should  have  shown  herself  to  our  longing  gaze.  But, 
alas  for  mortal  expectations !  the  clouds  had  collected deeply  and  thickly,  and  of  the  splendid  panorama  we  had  anticipated  scarcely  two-thirds  were 
visible.  The  two  snow-crowned  volcanoes,  Popocatepetl and  Iztaccihuatl,  were  completely  shrouded  in 
mist ;  so  that  altogether  we  must  class  the  ""  view  ""  as 
a  dreamy  to  come  true  in  the  future  I  hope.  To-day 
we  have  done  nothing  beyond  ""fixing""  ourselves, 
as  the  Yankees  say, — installed  ourselves  comfortably 
in  our  rooms,  unpacked  our  things,  and  received  a 
visit  from  our  Minister,  Mr.  Doyle ;  after  which  we 
occupied  ourselves  till  dusk  in  looking  out  of  the 
window,  here  a  very  edifying  employment,  when 
every  human  being  that  passes  is  a  picture  in  him 
or  herself.  We  took  a  short  walk  this  evening  in 
the  Plaza.  The  people  most  do  congregrate  in  a 
part  of  it  called  las  Cadences,  from  the  chains 
linking  together  the  rails  in  front  of  the  cathedral. 
I  shall  now  conclude  this  long  letter,  hoping  it  may 
reach  its  destination  safely. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 

C. "
18,"Mexico,  Hotel   San   Augustin,    October    9th. — My 

dear  Father, I  hope  this  will  be  an  acceptable 

present  to  you,  being  the  only  birth-day  memorial 
circumstances  at  this  moment  allow  of  my  sending. 
We  found  full  occupation  the  first  morning  or  two 
after  our  arrival  in  making  topographical  discoveries, 
and  tracing  out  a  few  plans  of  our  future  movements. 
In  the  former  there  is  not  much  difficulty,  for  the 
streets  are  large,  wide,  and  run  chiefly  at  right  aogles 
from  one  another.  It  is  a  very  beautiful  town,  judging of  it  even  by  its  external  appearance  only  :•  it  may 
well  be  called  a  city  of  palaces,  for  I  do  not  recollect 
observing  a  single  poor  or  mean-looking  house  in  it. 
The  extreme  clearness  of  the  atmosphere  causes  even 
the  far-distant  mountains  to  appear  close  at  the  end 
of  the  vista  formed  in  every  street ;  yet  the  nearest 
mountain  is  forty  miles  off.  ....  When  cliez  moi  I 
find  the  attraction  of  the  balcony  almost  irresistible. 
The  men  with  their  graceful  ""  serapes,""  and  the 
women  with  their  ungraceful  ""  rebosos  "" — the  dark 
eyes  and  swarthy  complexions  common  to  both  sexes ; 
then  add  to  these  the  singular,  and,  in  some  instances, 
musical  cries  of  the  various  vendors  of  goods,  eatables, and  drinkables,  and  you  have  a  scene  quite 
unsurpassable  in  its  way.  The  varieties  of  complexion are  curious ;  every  shade  from  pale  yellow  to 
dark  copper  colour  is  to  be  found  here.  The  ""serape  "" 
is  a  kind  of  double  blanket  of  the  most  brilliant  and 
varied  hues  :  a  hole  in  the  centre  admits  the  head  of 
the  wearer,  and  the  two  ends  may  be  worn  either 
simply  hanging  down  from  the  neck,  before  and 
behind,  or  may  be  twisted  round  the  body,  or  thrown 
mantilla-fashion  over  the  shoulders.  Among  other 
natural  curiosities  I  saw  an  Indian  chief  going  to  sell 
some  embroidered  things  at  market.  He  was  dressed 
in  a  tunic  of  fur,  and  wore  a  beautiful  crown  of 
ostrich  feathers  on  his  head.  I  do  not  think  the 
Mexican  people  have  good  expressions,  though  their 
features  are  generally  handsome;  but  they  have  a 
downward  look  about  the  eyes  which  is  unpleasant, 
and  gives  one  the  idea  of  their  having  some  mischief 
always  lurking  somewhere.  They  are  a  strange  people from  all  accounts :  they  would  think  nothing  of 
murdering  you,  with  or  without  reason ;  yet  they  are 
as  civil,  as  kind,  as  ready  to  oblige,  as  warm  in  manner, and  as  anxious  to  please,  as  if  your  pleasure  was 
their  only  care,  and  that  not  only  to  strangers  but  to 
each  other.  It  is  difficult  to  reconcile  this  apparent 
warm-heartedness  with  the   cruel  and  blood-thirsty 
natures  they  show  sometimes. 

We  rode  on  horseback  yesterday  morning  to  Chapultepec,  accompanied  by  Mr.  Berkeley  and  Mr. 
Portman,  the  two  attaches.  A  most  beautiful  ride, 
and  affording  a  far  finer  view  of  Mexico  than  from 
the  Vera  Cruz  side.  This  grand  old  place,  so  much 
associated  with  some  of  the  most  stirring  events  connected with  the  Mexican  Conquest  and  the  history  of 
the  days  of  Cortez  and  Montezuma,  must  look  very 
different  now  from  what  was  its  aspect  then  :  so  different, indeed,  that,  could  any  of  the  actors  in  those 
scenes  now  rise  from  their  graves  and  look  upon  it, 
I  should  doubt  their  being  able  to  recognise,  in  the 
stately  but  sad  Chapultepec  of  the  present  day,  the 
bright  and  flowery  gardens  of  which  we  read  so 
charming  a  description  in  the  glowing  pages  of 
Prescott.  Here  is  to  be  seen  one  of  the  few  exceptions to  the  rule  of  the  unchangeableness  of  nature. 
Scarcely  three  hundred  years  have  elapsed,  yet  what 
is  now  covered  with  corn-fields,  potatoes,  tobacco,  and 
other  necessaries  of  life  to  the  modern  Mexican,  was 
then  a  vast  lake,  reflecting  on  its  glassy  surface  the 
cypress  trees  and  pleasure  gardens  of  this  favourite 
resort  of  Montezuma.  The  aqueduct,  too,  now 
broken  and  in  ruins,  like  those  on  the  old  Eoman 
Campagna,  then  conveyed  its  pure  and  bountiful  supplies to  all  the  thirsty  city.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
most  striking  feature  now  offered  to  the  eye  is  the 
magnificent  castle  or  stronghold,  built  on  the  summit 
of  the  porphyry  rock,  once  the  burial  place  of  the 
Indian  kings.    One  of  the  Spanish  vice-kings,  named 
Gralvez,  was  the  projector  and  builder  of  this  fortress, 
towards  the  end  of  the  last  century.     His  avowed 
purpose  was  simply  the  erection  of  a  summer  residence for  his  own  pleasure,  but  as  the  work  of  construction advanced  it  assumed  so  greatly  the  form  of 
a  fortification,  which  in  such  a  neighbourhood  was 
considered   by  the   Government  at  home,   and  not 
unreasonably,  I  think,  as  too  regal  an  abode  for  a 
subject,  and  consequently  it  was  annexed   by  the 
Crown,  though  unlike  some  other  annexations  I  have 
heard  of,  Gralvez,  the  original  owner,  was  well  compensated for  his  outlay.     But  the  building  was  never 
furnished  internally,  having,  even  in  its  present  state, 
says  Madame  Calderon  de  la  Barca,  cost  the  Spanish 
300,000   dollars.       The  general   appearance,  shape, 
and  situation  of  the  Castle  of  Chapultepec  reminds 
me  very  much  (its  colour  only  excepted)  of  the  old 
Grerman   fortress  of  Heidelberg.      The    rocky   and 
wooded  hill,  the  river  and  the  valley,  with  the  fertile 
plain    spread   beyond,    mark   both.       Further    the 
parallel  cannot   be  drawn,  as  from   Heidelberg  no 
splendid  imperial   city  can  be  seen.      It  would  be 
difficult  indeed  to  find  one  in  Europe  now  that  could 
compare  in  grandeur  with  Mexico.     Eome  or  Athens 
in  former  days  might  have  done  so,  but  in  their 
present  state  can  scarcely  even  rival  her  in  architecture (barring  always  St.  Peter's,  which  stands  alone 
""  of  temples  old  or  altars  new  "").  The  present  Republican  Government  have  turned  the  old  Castle  into 
a  college,  for  teaching  young  military  ideas  how  to 
shoot.  Entirely  surrounding  the  sides  and  base  of 
the  hill  on  which  the  Castle  is  built  are  the  most 
gigantic  cypress  trees  that  I  imagine  exist  in  the 
world ;  their  appearance  is  altogether  so  extraordinary, that  when  once  they  have  arrested  the  attention 
it  is  difficult  either  to  look  at  or  think  of  anything 
else.  It  is  certain  from  the  ancient  chronicles  and 
accounts  that  have  been  handed  down  to  us,  that 
these  trees  were  not  only  living  but  had  attained 
their  full  growth  at  the  time  of  Cortez's  invasion  and 
conquest.  One  of  these,  called  par  excellence  Montezuma's,  is  of  the  immense  circumference  of  fifty  feet. 
They  all  now  wear  a  most  curious  appearance ;  a 
kind  of  parasite,  or  moss  of  a  greyish  white  colour, 
twines  about  their  trunks,  and  hangs  in  wild  profusion from  their  branches.  It  has  the  exact  appearance of  long  grey  hair,  and,  especially  being  contrasted with  the  deep  almost  black  colour  of  the 
cypress  branches,  has  a  most  singular  effect.  The 
local  names  given  to  these  hairy-looking  masses  are 
""  Bisnagas  ""  or  ""  Cabeza  de  Viejo  ""  (old  man's  head). 
The  cypress  trees  themselves  are  called  ""Ahuahuetes."" 
After  wandering  about  for  some  time  in  the  ""  cold 
shade  ""  of  this  forest  ""  aristocracy/'  we  remounted 
our  steeds  and  went  to  Tacubaya,  which  formed  a 
kind  of  suburb  of  Mexico,  and  is  a  good  deal  frequented by  the  residents  there  when  they  wish  to 
change  air  or  scene.  There  are  several  pretty  villas, with  gardens  attached,  studded  about.  In  one 
of  these  we  were  very  hospitably  entertained  at 
breakfast ;  our  host  was  an  Englishman,  Mr.  Greaves, 
with  a  pretty  wife  and  sister-in-law,  both  much 
admired  in  this  country,  where  the  fair  and  bright 
English  complexion  is  as  rare  as  beautiful.  Tacubaya 
would  almost  appear  to  be  one  vast  flower  garden ; 
the  profusion  of  roses  of  all  hues  and  sizes  is  really 
astonishing.  Among  other  notable  personages  who 
are  ruralising  here  at  present  is  General  Santa  Anna, 
the  actual  President  of  the  Mexican  Kepublic,  consequently, one  constantly  meets  or  is  overtaken  by 
aide-de-camps,  messengers,  soldiers,  &c.,  riding  in 
hot  haste  to  and  fro ;  some  of  them,  too,  looking  so 
big  with  importance  that  they  might  have  been 
bearers,  at  least,  of  tidings  of  some  new  pronunciamento.  Before  returning  home  we  went  to  the  top 
of  Mr.  G-eaves's  house,  called  the  ""  Azotea,""  to  look 
at  the  surrounding  view,  which  is  the  same  as  from 
Chapultepec,  but  with  the  very  important  addition  of 
that  fine  old  castle  and  its  grey-bearded  trees,  ""which 
it  need  scarcely  be  said  are  no  inconsiderable  features 
in  the  general  beauty  of  the  landscape. 

I  find  I  have  forgotten  to  mention  that  the  day 
before  yesterday  we  dined  at  the  Embassy  with  Mr. 
Doyle,  and  afterwards  accompanied  him  to  the  opera, 
called  (till  further  orders)  El  Teatro  de  Santa  Anna. 
It  is  a  good-sized  house,  and  handsomely  though 
heavily  decorated ;  but  it  is  far  inferior  in  every  way 
to  the  Tacon  at  Havana.  The  performers,  on  the 
other  hand,  seem  better ;  the  voices  excellent ;  and 
for  the  most  part  both  men  and  women  seem  to  be 
thorough  musicians.  It  would  be  difficult  to  pronounce upon  their  personal  appearance,  however,  for 
the  theatre  is  so  badly  lighted  that  one  person  can 
scarcely  be  distinguished  from  another. 

We  rode  this  morning  to  the  Paseo  before  breakfast. Notwithstanding  the  early  hour,  all  the  world 
was  abroad  in  carriages  or  on  horseback.  The  former 
are  lumbering  awkward  looking  machines,  something 
like  German  coaches.  Singularly  enough,  they  do 
not  seem  here  to  have  a  notion  of  the  pleasure  or 
convenience  of  an  open  carriage;  the  more  inexplicable an  omission  in  a  climate  so  peculiarly  adapted 
for  such  an  enjoyment.  It  seemed  to  me  quite  a 
waste  of  the  bounties  of  nature,  with  a  warm  but  not 
hot  sun  shining,  a  soft  and  balmy  air,  to  see  half  a 
'dozen  people  caged  up  in  one  of  these  ponderous 
vehicles,  one  head  peeping  above  another  at  the  narrow  window.  This  can  scarcely  be  called  taking  an 
airing.  Nothing  can  be  more  picturesque,  on  the 
other  hand,  than  the  Mexican  cavalier's  costume, 
when  adhered  to  in  its  true  character,  and  not  ""  improved,"" or  ""  spoilt ""  (the  terms  in  this  case  being 
synonymous),  by  the  introduction  of  English  or 
Yankee  fashions.  The  dress  has  been  so  often  described and  is  so  familiar  to  most  people,  that  it 
would  seem  almost  a  work  of  supererogation  to  give 
a  catalogue  raisonnee  of  its  component  parts.  The 
Paseo  we  visited  this  morning  is  called  ""  El  Paseo  de 
Bucarelli,""  the  viceroy  of  that  name  having  planned 
it,  and  during  whose  government  it  was  completed. 
It  bears  the  same  family  resemblance  to  all  other 
Paseos,  Alamedas,  and  public  promenades  I  have 
already  mentioned  elsewhere.  The  different  species 
of  trees  growing  along  their  sides  being  the  chief 
points  by  which  one  may  distinguish  the  public 
walks  of  one  country  or  town  from  another :  thus,  at 
Havana  the  palm  tree  is  the  chosen  one ;  here  it  is 
the  pepper  tree,  a  native  of  Peru,  I  believe,  originally ; 
it  takes,  nevertheless,  kindly  to  this  soil,  and  though 
not  possessing  the  grandeur  or  majestic  bearing  of 
the  palm,  is  still  excessively  graceful  and  beautiful 
in  its  own  way.  The  leaves  are  of  a  dark  shining 
green,  and  the  fruit  or  pepper  berries  bright  scarlet. 
They  grow  in  bunches,  not  unlike  the  mountain  ash  in 
size  and  colour ;  but  instead  of  forming  one  large  head 
of  berries  like  it,  the  pepper  grows  like  bunches  of 
grapes,  hanging  downwards  like  them,  or  deciduously 
as  perhaps  you  would  say. 

E.  has  gone  with  the  Legation  to  a  bull  fight ; 
but  that  being  an  exhibition  I  have  never  been  able  to 
make  up  my  mind  to  witness  (unless  I  could  make 
sure  of  seeing  some  of  the  men  killed  who  so  cruelly 
torture  the  bulls,  and,  far  worse  still,  their  helpless 
and  courageous  horses),  I  have  profited  by  the  opportunity of  enjoying  a  tranquil  hour  or  two  in  writing 
to  you. 

Ever  yours  affectionately,

19,"Mexico,  October  12th. — This  morning,  my  dear 
Father,  we  devoted  to  the  Paseo  de  las  Vigas  :  went 
by  one  road  and  returned  across  the  fields  by  another. 
Had  a  splendid  view  of  the  whole  valley  and  the  chain 
of  mountains  in  all  their  glory,  including  the  two 
volcanoes,  Popocatepetl  and  Iztaccihuatl ;  the  English for  the  latter  name  is  ""  The  White  Lady.""  Some 
say  it  was  called  after  the  beautiful  Indian  mistress 
of  Cortez,  Malintzin,  the  Malinche  hills  being  the 
group  of  which  Iztaccihuatl  is  the  chief.  Malintzin 
was  christened  soon  after  the  Spaniards  had  entered 
Mexico,  being  named  Marina,  and  it  was  as  Dona 
Marina  she  played  so  important  and  romantic  a  part 
in  the  history  of  the  conquest.  It  is  a  wondrous  love 
tale,  and  far  outstrips  in  its  unadorned  veracity  the 
imaginations  of  most  writers  of  fiction.  The  affection, 
so  sudden  in  its  growth,  yet  so  faithful  and  so  true, 
through  good  report  and  through  evil,  remained  unchanging to  the  end,  at  least  to  her  end, — that  is,  when 
she  was  married,  literally  disposed  of, — when  the  news 
came  that  the  legitimate  wife  of  Cortez  was  leaving 
Spain  to  join  him  in  the  new  world.  I  have  often 
speculated  on  what  Dona  Marina's  thoughts  and 
feelings  may  have  been  on  this  subject.  Did  she 
know  of  the  tie  which  bound  her  lover,  or  was  that 
tenet  of  the  Christian  faith  which  binds  husband 
and  wife  to  each  other  only  till  death,  left  untaught to  her,  when  she  threw  her  lot  with  Cortez, 
and  made  his  God  her  Grod  ?  And  then  when  the 
last  and  worst  trial  came  for  both, —  when  the  almost 
hated  but  still  lawful  wife  of  Cortez  appeared  on  the 
scene,  did  Marina  yield  to  persuasion,  entreaty, 
threats,  in  consenting  to  marry  another,  or  was  it  an 
expiation?  Did  she  hope  to  ""bear  the  martyr's 
cross,  to  win  the  martyr's  crown  ? ""  Quien  sabe ! 
But  it's  a  strange  tale,  and  would  make  a  fertile 
theme  for  the  romance  writer.  The  name  of  Dona 
Marina's  husband  was  Don  Juan  de  Jamarillo.  It  is 
rarely  found,  in  other  cases  bearing  any  resemblance 
to  this,  that  the  name  of  the  second  hero  should  be 
rescued  from  oblivion ;  but  this  certainly,  it  must  be 
owned,  was  an  exceptional  circumstance.  It  is  very 
provoking,  however,  that  from  the  time  of  her 
marriage  no  further  record  of  her  life  is  to  be  met 
with,  not  even  of  the  period  or  manner  of  her  death. 
Whether  she  was  happy,  or  miserable,  or  neither, 
but  ""contented,""  tradition  sayeth  not:  only  the 
kindly  feeling  and  grateful  recollection  with  which 
even  to  this  day  her  name  is  mentioned  as  the  good 
angel  both  of  Spain  and  Mexico  in  those  stormy 
times.  To  return  to  our  promenade  after  this  flight 
of  imagination;  the  Paseo  de  las  Vigas  is  frequented during  part  of  the  year  (the  spring  and 
early  summer  from  March  till  May,  I  believe)  as  the 
fashionable  lounge  instead  of  the  Buccarelli ;  the 
chief  attraction  there,  consisting  in  the  drive,  being 
along  the  borders  of  the  canal.  While  the  Mexican 
beau  monde  disport  themselves  in  their  carriages,  or 
on  their  caracoling  horses,  the  picturesque-looking 
Indians  with  their  families  are  rowing  or  floating 
past  on  their  canoes  laden  with  flowers  and  fruit. 
At  all  times  this  must  be  a  pleasing  spectacle,  and 
even  now  as  we  witnessed  it  to-day,  though  not 
""the  season,""  the  coup  d'ceil  was  most  attractive. 
The  Indian  love  for  flowers  is  almost  a  religion ; 
and  the  way  in  which  they  decorate  not  merely  their 
persons,  but  every  object  they  employ  in  daily  life, 
with  these  natural  ornaments,  throws  a  halo  of 
beauty  and  romance  over  the  commonest  things. 
In  the  spring  and  flowering  time,  of  course,  the 
brilliancy  of  the  show  is  enhanced  tenfold ;  hence 
the  fashionable  season  for  las  Vigas  occurs  at  that 
period.  I  have  propounded  a  theory  !  Nothing  very 
abstruse ;  it  concerns  ""  only  a  woman's  hair,""  that 
is  to  say,  the  way  of  dressing  it ;  but  it  seems  to  me 
that  the  mode  of  wearing  the  hair  plaited  en  couronne  round  the  head,  which  we  have  adopted  of 
late,  and  the  Italians  many  years  ago,  must  have 
been  of  Indian  origin.  How  the  Europeans  obtained it  would  be  another  fertile  field  of  argument, 
as  difficult  perhaps,  though  less  important  to  determine than  the  much  vexed  question,  whence 
the  traces  of  the  symbols  of  the  Christian  faith, 
which  have  been  found  in  Mexico  to  have  existed 
ages  before  the  existence  of  America  was  known  ? 
.  .  .  .  To  return  to  the  hair.  Every  Indian 
woman  you  meet,  whatever  may  be  her  calling  or 
occupation,  wears  her  hair  in  a  heavy  coil  or  plait 
across  the  head,  and  this  plait  is  invariably  studded, 
either  with  bright  coloured  flowers,  or  (and  this  is 
the  more  common  way)  interlaced  with  what  looks 
like  a  crimson  cord,  but  is  in  reality  the  long  leaf 
of  an  aquatic  plant  dyed  to  the  colour.  Talking  of 
costume,  I  took  advantage  of  a  short  interval  of 
leisure  to-day,  to  pay  a  visit  to  a  vendor  of  wax 
figures ;  for  the  manufacture  of  which  the  Mexicans 
are  so  famous.  You  would  most  likely  remember 
seeing  some  beautiful  specimens  at  the  Great  Exhibition. We  have  made  several  purchases,  as 
presents  for  home  friends,  though  I  greatly  fear 
they  will  get  broken  in  the  course  of  the  long 
journey  they  will  have  to  take.  One  of  the  women 
I  bought  represents  a  fruit  seller,  and  it  is  really 
wonderful  to  observe  the  minuteness  with  which  every 
single  article  in  her  basket  is  copied  from  nature. 
The  same  with  her  dress ;  every  stripe,  every  thread 
in  the  various  garments  she  wears,  is  to  the  life. 
My  man  is  a  pulque  seller,  with  the  sort  of  pipe  or 
cask  containing  the  delicious  beverage  on  his  back. 
He  wears  a  magnificent  serape,  silver  earrings, 
pointed  hat,  and  the  orthodox  double  pair  of  unmentionables, ornamented  down  each  ""  limb  ""  with  a 
row  of  silver  buttons.  Adieu,  now,  hasta  luego.  I 
am  getting  on  pretty  well  in  Spanish. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 
C. "
20,"Mexico,  October  I&h. — Yesterday,  my  dear  Father, 
we  had  a  most  busy  day, —  a  regular  round  of  sight- 
seeing. First  of  all,  we  had  a  diplomatic  riding- 
party,  Spain,  France,  and  England  contributing  a 
representative.  Thus  escorted,  we  set  off  at  the 
early  hour  of  seven  in  the  morning  on  a  pilgrimage 
to  the  shrine  of  Nuestra  Senora  de  Guadeloupe, 
about  four  miles  distant.  This  Virgin  is  the  person 
who  does  everything  needful  for  Mexico  and  the 
Mexicans ;  consequently  she  is  held  in  great  esteem, 
and  many  are  the  offerings  dedicated  to  her.  We 
went  into  the  church,  but  did  not  linger  there  very 
long,  as  there  is  not  much  now  in  it  to  attract  or 
interest  strangers.  Formerly  the  altar  and  railing 
were  of  solid  silver;  but  now  that  is  all  changed. 
The  real  ore  has  been  melted  down,  and  in  its  stead 
there  is  now  but  a  tawdry  £m-looking  imitation. 
The  miraculous  picture,  which,  as  the  legend  relates, 
was  painted  in  one  night  by  the  Mater  Dolorosa 
herself  on  the  cloak  of  an  Indian  who  had  fallen 
asleep  enshrouded  in  its  folds,  we  looked  at  as  in 
duty  bound.  This  picture,  in  any  time  of  trouble 
or  need,  is  carried  about  in  public  from  church  to 
church,  by  way  of  reminding  the  heavenly  artist  of 
the  protection  she  volunteered  in  former  days  to 
Mexico.  The  principal  object  of  our  expedition, 
however,  was  the  view  from  another  chapel  on  the 
top  of  a  steepish  hill,  also  dedicated  to  the  Virgin. 
Here  we  were  amply  repaid  for  our  early  rising; 
everything  was  literally  couleur  de  rose,  bathed 
in  the  beautiful  early  sunlight,  the  air  soft  and  laden 
with  perfume.  There  is  here  close  to  the  chapel  a 
most  extraordinary  structure,  erected  by  a  Spaniard 
as  an  ex  voto  offering  to  the  Lady,  of  Gruedaloupe  for 
having  delivered  him  from  the  perils  of  shipwreck. 
It  is  made  of  brick,  or  something  that  looks  like 
brick,  and  is  in  the  shape  and  of  the  size  of  the 
mainsail  of  a  ship,  —  an  original  notion,  at  any  rate, 
though  the  effect  is  not  very  happy  in  the  execution. 
Cantered  back  to  breakfast  after  this  very  enjoyable 
excursion  with  good  spirits  and  rather  extra  good 
appetites.  Later  in  the  day  we  visited  the  Mint, 
and  saw  the  whole  process  of  making  and  coining 
the  dollars.  It  was  most  interesting  to  me,  as  it 
happened  I  had  never  seen  anything  of  the  sort 
before.  The  director  of  the  Mint  made  me  a  present 
of  a  dollar  that  I  had  seen  go  through  its  various 
transmutations.  On  leaving  this,  we  went  to  the 
Mineria,  or  school  of  mines.  It  contains  a  collection 
of  mineral  productions  of  various  kinds,  very  much 
like  all  other  such  assemblages,  only  not  quite  so 
good  as  most.  But  the  thing  to  be  seen  is  the 
palace  which  contains  them,  not  the  contents  themselves. It  is  a  wonderfully  beautiful  edifice — I  should 
imagine  on  the  model  of  the  Alhambra ;  the  Moorish 
arches  and  columns,  the  fountains  and  general  exuberance of  ornament,  is  quite  what  I  suppose  the 
Alhambra  to  be.  The  architect  of  this  Mexican 
chef  d'ceuvre  was  Tolosa.  We  next  proceeded  to  the 
University,  in  the  court  of  which  there  is  a  very  fine 
equestrian  statue  of  Charles  IV.  of  Spain.  The 
statue  is  of  bronze,  and  is  a  masterpiece  of  the  same 
sculptor ;  but  a  statue,  however  beautiful,  is  no  such 
uncommon  thing :  the  singularity  of  this  is,  that  the 
horse  is  represented  trotting  in  the  peculiar  manner 
the  Spanish  call  el  paso,  and  we,  I  believe,  call 
ambling ;  that  is,  the  fore  and  hind  legs  of  the  same 
side  advancing  together.  In  another  part  of  this 
courtyard  is  preserved  that  frightful  relic  of  barbarism, the  sacrificial  stone,  with  the  notch  cut  out  in 
it  for  resting  the  head  of  the  victim  while  he  was 
being  subjected  to  tortures  which  it  makes  one's 
blood  curdle  to  think  of.  The  sacrifice  was  to  propitiate the  gods  of  the  barbarians,  who  afterwards, 
to  please  themselves,  cooked  and  ate  the  remains. 
I  cannot,  after  reading  the  accounts'  which  have 
been  transmitted  to  us  of  these  horrors,  either 
pity  the  Indians  or  wonder  at  the  Spaniards  committing any  cruelties  upon  the  savages  when  they 
had  the  opportunity;  for  it  must  be  remembered 
that  on  many  occasions  when  the  fortune  of  war 
had  delivered  some  of  Cortez's  people  into  the 
hands  of  the  Aztecs,  they  were  put  to  death  with 
all  the  same  accessories  of  torment  as  those  sacrificed 
to  the  gods,  and  in  the  sight  and  almost  hearing  of 
their  comrades.  We  made  an  ineffectual  attempt  to 
see  the  Museum,  but  some  reparations  are  going  on 
which  will  keep  it  closed  for  another  week  or  so. 
We  obtained  access,  however,  to  the  Botanical  Garden 
which  is  attached  to  it.  The  state  of  neglect  into 
which  this  has  fallen  is  quite  melancholy.  I  suppose, 
because  Providence  has  allowed  everything  to  grow 
without  any  trouble,  the  people  consequently  will 
not  give  themselves  any.  We  had  a  gorgeous 
bouquet  presented  to  each  of  us,  including  floripundios,  white  and  red,  besides  many  other  beautiful- 
hued  flowers  of  which  I  do  not  know  the  botanical 
names  and  do  not  understand  the  Mexican;  but  I 
remarked  nevertheless  that  all  these  blossoms,  lovely 
as  they  undoubtedly  were,  were  of  the  most  ordinary 
description  in  Mexico,  every  cottage  garden,  or 
rather  what  would  answer  to  such  with  us,  containing 
them  all.  I  told  the  gardener  I  thought  he  had  a 
sinecure  and  employed  his  time  accordingly,  at  which 
he  seemed  much  affronted.  Concluded  this  busy 
day  with  a  dinner  at  the  Spanish  Embassy.  The 
present  envoy  of  Spain  to  the  Mexican  Kepublic  is 
the  Marquis  de  la  Eibera.  The  Captain-General, 
who  is  a  very  old  friend  of  his,  gave  me  a  letter  of 
introduction,  and  we  have  found  both  him  and 
Madame  de  Ribera  among  the  kindest  and  best  of 
the  many  friends  we  have  made  among  the  Spanish 
people.  The  Marquise  is  truly,  and  in  the  best  sense 
of  the  word,  ""  a  charming  woman,""  uniting  the  most 
endearing  qualities  in  herself.  She  is  a  daughter  of 
the  Due  de  Eivas,  thereby  possessing  some  of  the 
best  blood  in  Spain. "
21,"Real  del  Monte,  Oct.  1 5th,  11  P.M.  —We  left  Mexico 
at  six  this  morning,  on  our  way  to  the  far-famed  silver 
mines  of  Real  del  Monte.  We  had  engaged  a  diligence to  take  us  the  first  fifty  miles,  which  chiefly 
traverse  a  plain,  and  had  sent  on  our  horses  to  meet 
us  at  the  village  of  Haltepec,  together  with  our 
escort,  twenty-four  men  (mounted)  whom  Santa  Anna, 
acceding  to  the  request  Mr.  Doyle  had  made  in  our 
behalf,  kindly  granted  for  our  protection  against  the 
perils  of  the  route,  said  to  be  considerable  in  these 
parts.  The  officer  in  command  of  the  escort  travelled 
with  us  in  the  ""waggon.""  Just  as  we  arrived  at 
Haltepec,  a  divertissement  occurred  which  thoroughly 
disturbed  my  gravity  for  the  rest  of  the  journey. 
For  some  time  I  had  been  very  uncomfortable,  owing 
to  the  seat  of  the  carriage  being  so  high ;  my  feet 
could  not  reach  the  ground,  and,  after  sundry  attempts to  obtain  some  resting-place  for  them,  I  did 
at  last  touch  something  under  the  seat  opposite  to 
me ;  and,  finding  it  yield,  I  gradually,  with  the  aid  of 
both  feet,  drew  it  under  me  (apparently  it  was  a 
black  bag),  and  for  an  hour  or  two  enjoyed  a  considerable increase  of  comfort.  When  within  half  a  mile 
of  Haltepec,  as  I  have  said,  I  observed  ""  our  Captain  "" 
hunting,  fumbling,  and  peering  about  in  all  directions. At  last  he  approached  me,  and  on  stooping 
and  seeing  on  what  I  was  reposing  my  feet,  shall  I 
ever  forget  the  ludicrous  horror  depicted  on  his 
countenance  as  he  ejaculated  ""  Santa  Maria  Purissima ! ! ""  I  burst  into  a  violent  fit  of  laughter, 
when,  to  make  matters  better,  he  seized  my  ankles 
with  both  hands,  rudely  pushed  them  to  one  side, 
and  pointed,  for  he  was  past  speech,  at  the  black 
bundle  under  me.  Poor  man !  no  wonder  he  was 
terrified ;  the  bag  contained  a  pair  of  loaded  blunderbusses, and  I  had  cleverly  managed  to  turn  the 
muzzles  upwards,  and  pointed  to  myself.  It  was  a 
miracle,  certainly,  that  I  escaped ;  yet,  with  it  all,  the 
ridiculous  has  so  far  outweighed  the  dangerous,  that 
I  cannot  ever  think  of  it  for  a  moment  with  becoming 
seriousness.  We  remained  about  an  hour  to  refresh 
ourselves  at  Haltepec,  then  mounted  our  horses,  and 
set  forth  a  numerous  company;  but  the  weather, 
which  had  previously  been  fine  and  sunny,  suddenly 
changed,  and  we  were  caught  in  a  terrific  storm 
of  rain,  which  unfortunately  lasted  a  considerable 
time.  We  must  have  had  a  most  imposing  appearance as  we  galloped  into  the  little  village  of 
Pachuca.  About  thirty  people  we  were  in  all,  and 
the  escort,  at  least,  not  to  speak  of  ourselves,  looked 
exceedingly  picturesque, — the  graceful  sombreros,  the 
flowing  serapes,  and  last,  not  least,  the  thoroughbred-looking horses,  nearly  all  of  whom  in  this 
country  have  Arabian  blood.  We  made  a  grand 
entree  into  the  court-yard  of  the  hacienda,  wet  and 
dripping  as  we  were.  Here  our  staff  of  soldiers  left 
us,  after  receiving  our  sincere  thanks  for  their  safeguard ;  and  I  bad  adieu  to  my  frightened  Captain, 
who  had  not  recovered  from  his  attaque  de  nerfs,  I 
believe,  when  he  left  us.  We  now  proceeded  to 
ascend  the  hill  leading  to  Real  del  Monte.  The 
road  is  somewhat  barren,  the  maguey  and  the  prickly 
pear  being  the  only  vegetation  growing  near ;  but 
the  distant  mountain  scenery  is  wild  and  beautiful. Before  we  arrived  at  our  journey's  end  it  became bitterly  cold,  and  the  air  so  rarefied  that 
breathing  was  laborious.  This,  however,  is  no  great 
wonder,  as  Eeal  is  10,000  feet  above  the  level  of  the 
sea.  We  were  by  no  means  sorry  to  arrive  at  Mr. 
Auld's  house,  where  we  were  most  hospitably  welcomed by  him  and  Mrs.  Auld.  Mr.  Auld  is  the 
director  of  the  mines,  and,  I  believe,  a  shareholder. 
They  are  worked  and  managed  entirely  by  an  English company.  Indeed,  so  completely  English  is 
the  place  considered,  that  in  Mexico,  when  your 
friends  hear  that  you  contemplate  a  trip  to  Real  del 
Monte,  they  are  accustomed  to  observe,  ""You  are 
going  to  England !  ""  Certainly,  several  of  the  peculiarities of  our  manners  and  customs  were  visible 
immediately  on  our  arrival,  but  were  none  the  less 
welcome.  Perhaps  the  most  agreeable  of  all,  for  the 
first  impression,  was  the  sight  of  a  blazing  fire  in 
Mrs.  Auld's  drawing-room.  At  any  rate,  I  never  remember enjoying  one  so  much  even  in  England.  I 
hope  you  will  give  me  due  credit  for  my  determination in  sitting  up  to  write  to  you  at  this  time  of 
night,  for  I  am  very  tired  and  sleepy ;  but  as  I  anticipate being  still  more  so  to-morrow,  as  we  are,  I 
hear,  to  be  on  horseback  all  day,  I  am  afraid,  were 
I  to  delay  my  daily  chronicle  till  then,  I  might  forget or  omit  something  which,  nevertheless,  you  might 
like  to  know.  My  next  letter  will  most  likely  not 
be  written  till  we  are  back  again  in  Mexico,  but  I 
shall  jot  down  a  few  notes  en  attendant. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 
C. "
22,"Mexico,  21  st.  —  We  are  once  more  here  again,  my 
dear  Father,  having  accomplished  our  English  expedition in  safety.  Altogether  the  excursion  has  been 
most  agreeable.  As  I  told  you  was  my  intention,  I 
took  notes  of  the  various  incidents  as  they  occurred, 
and  therefore  I  will  without  further  apology  tran- 
scribe them  tale  quale. 

16th. — Found  this  morning  that  our  poor  horses 
were  completely  knocked  up,  so  much  so  that  it  is 
doubtful  if  they  will  be  fit  for  work  again  for  many 
weeks  to  come,  even  if  they  are  then.  This  is  most 
vexatious,  as,  should  they  prove  unfit  for  service  as 
long  as  this,  I  shall  have  paid  *  601.  for  this  excursion 
alone,  as  the  horses,  with  their  saddles  and  accoutrements included,  cost  me  this  sum.  Mr.  Auld,  however, provided  us  with  steeds  from  his  stable  to-day, 
and  we  rode  to  Eegla,  once  the  residence  of  the 
Counts  of  Eegla,  the  owners  of  all  these  rich  mines. 
The  only  house  now  on  the  estate  is  a  hacienda 
(equivalent  in  English  to  a  farmhouse),  where,  on 
receiving  the  silver  out  of  the  mines,  they  work  and 
separate  it  from  the  earth  in  which  it  is  hidden,  and 
by  a  series  of  processes  which,  although  I  saw,  I 
should  fear  making  a  mistake  were  I  to  attempt  to 
describe  minutely,  they  finally  form  it  into  bars,  in 
which  state  it  is  forwarded  to  Mexico,  either  for 
coining  there  or  for  exportation  to  other  countries 
as  specie.  The  natural  beauties  of  Eegla  are  great ; 
indeed,  during  the  whole  of  our  ride  the  scenery  was 
charming.  The  hacienda  is  imbedded  in  a  hole,  to 
use  a  common  but  very  expressive  word ;  this  same 
hole  being  walled  by  two  gigantic  chains  of  rocks 
called  by  the  learned  basaltic  columns.  The  name 
given  them  here  is  the  ""  Giant's  Causeway.""  They 
are  most  curious-looking — resemble  the  barrels  of  an 
organ,  and  seem  much  more  as  if  they  were  made  by 
art  than  nature.  The  house  is  now  inhabited  by  the 
superintendent  of  the  company,  a  Mr.  Bell,  and  his 
wife,  from  the  north  of  England. 

18th. — Rose  at  four  in  the  morning,  and  were  in  our 
saddles  at  half-past  five  en  route  to  visit  a  famous 
barranca  and  see  from  it  the  sun  rise  over  the 
surrounding  mountains.  These  barrancas  are  like 
what  in  the  Alps  are  called  mountain  torrents,  only 
that  in  this  country  they  are  much  more  formidable 
and  much  larger;  they  seem  to  split  the  hills  asunder 
in  their  headlong  course.  From  the  spot  whence  we 
gazed  on  the  magnificent  view  unrolling  itself  beneath
and  around  us,  we  could  discern  in  the  distance  many 
of  these  wild  and  terrible-looking  chasms.  They  are 
now  dried  up,  but  in  the  rainy  season,  the  fury  of  the 
waters  dashing  down  these  rocky  channels,  and  carrying everything  away  with  their  irresistible  strength, 
it  is  neither  safe  nor  even  possible  sometimes  to 
approach  them.  We  returned  to  Eegla  to  breakfast, 
and  afterwards  took  leave  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Bell,  and 
retraced  our  steps  home,  i.  e.  to  Eeal  del  Monte. 
Mr.  Auld  took  us  on  our  way  to  visit  a  hacienda, 
called  San  Miguel,  also  belonging  to  the  Count  de 
Regla,  a  most  beautiful  spot  imbedded  in  trees,  with 
a  fresh  clear  lake  in  the  midst  of  them.  The  whole 
scene  had  an  English  park-like  appearance,  the  wonderful flowers  only  excepted,  with  which  we  cannot 
vie.  At  the  hacienda  itself  they  are  employed,  as 
most  of  the  other  occupants  in  these  parts,  in  working 
the  silver  after  it  is  taken  from  the  mines,  adding 
the  quicksilver,  &c.,  and  making  in  a  fit  state  for 
transport. 

19th. —  Took  another  ride  on  horseback  through 
scenery  even  more  magnificent,  if  possible,  than  that 
of  the  barranca.  We  had  to  descend  a  very  rugged 
and  slippery  path,  and  when  we  reached  the  bottom 
we  were  nearly  swamped  in  bogs  with  which  the  ground 
is  covered  in  some  parts.  But  we  enjoyed  a  near 
view  of  some  grand  old  rocks,  which  form  the  greatest 
attraction  of  the  landscape,  and  which  are  named 
""  Las  penas  cargadas.""  Dangerous  though  the  road 
was,  I  think  we  were  well  repaid  for  our  perseverance. 
We  saw  the  two  snow-capped  volcanoes  shining  in  all 
their  beauty.  I  had  no  idea  before  of  the  height  of 
these  two  mountains,  and  am  not  a  little  surprised  to 
find  they  both  overtop  Mont  Blanc  by  nearly  2000 
feet.  The  excessive  clearness  of  the  atmosphere  renders it  easy  to  deceive  the  eye.  Popocatapetl  and 
Iztaccihuatl  both,  but  especially  the  former,  look  as 
if  there  would  be  no  difficulty  whatever  in  riding  up 
to  the  top  in  a  couple  of  hours ;  yet  the  base  of  the 
nearer  of  the  two  is  forty  miles  off ! 

20th. — Went  into  one  of  the  silver  mines  called 
the  Kosario.  This  is  cut  through  the  side  of  the  hill, 
and  consequently  we  were  able  to  explore  it  without 
the  inconvenience  of  being  swung  down  in  baskets 
or  having  to  climb  up  rope  ladders.  We  were  sent 
in,  or  rather  drawn  in,  by  a  mule  in  a  sort  of  truck 
or  wheelbarrow,  in  which  we  lay  down  as  nearly  flat 
as  we  could,  with  candles  in  our  hands,  and  were  so 
trundled  on  for  about  a  quarter  of  a  mile.  We 
were  enveloped  from  head  to  foot  in  white  flannel 
drawers  and  gowns,  and  I  should  think  we  must 
have  looked  very  like  a  party  of  criminals  being  drawn 
to  execution.  The  Eosario  is  now  the  richest  of  the 
Real  del  Monte  mines  —  at  least  so  I  am  told.  The 
miners  seem  by  no  means  uncomfortable,  and  lead  a 
merry  life,  hammering  away  at  the  silvery  rock,  and 
singing  all  manner  of  songs,  comic  and  sentimental. 
They  gave  us  some  of  their  pulque  to  drink,  which 
this  time  we  did  not  think  so  bad.  We  also  obtained 
leave,  with  the  aid  of  a  chisel  and  hammer,  to  hew 
for  ourselves  some  specimens  of  the  ore. 

2lst. — Took  leave  of  our  hosts  at  Keal  del  Monte 
with  much  regret.  We  have  made  a  delightful 
excursion  and  a  most  agreeable  visit,  to  which  the 
only  drawback  has  been  its  brief  duration.  We  were 
obliged  to  leave  Mr.  Auld's  house  at  half-past  four 
o'clock  this  morning,  in  order  to  be  in  time  for  a 
diligence  which  was  to  pass  though  Pachuca  at  six. 
The  air  was  freezing :  I  don't  think  I  ever  suffered 
such  bitter  cold  before.  This  time  from  Pachuca 
we  availed  ourselves  of  the  ""  silver  escort,""  as  some 
bars  were  being  sent  on  to  Mexico,  which  we  therefore 
accompanied.  Our  journey  was  accomplished  without any  remarkable  incident,  and  we  reached  the 
city  in  safety  this  evening.  The  weather  being  fine 
to-day,  I  was  able  to  observe  what  previously  had 
escaped  me  in  the  hurried  gallop  across  the  plain  in 
the  storm  —  namely,  the  numbers  of  large  aloes  or 
magueys,  as  their  Mexican  name  is,  scattered  in  profusion all  over  the  country.  Some  few  were  in 
flower,  but  they  are  rare,  as  immediately  the  owner 
finds  his  maguey  is  about  to  blossom,  he  cuts  its 
head  off  for  the  sake  of  the  pulque  which  is  then  in 
the  long  stem  ready  to  nourish  the  flower,  but  which 
more  generally  he  prefers  should  nourish  him. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 
C."
23,"Mexico,  October  24th. — The  last  two  mornings,  my 
dear  Father,  have  been  almost  exclusively  devoted  to 
visiting  the  public  buildings,  churches,  &c.  On 
Sunday  we  went  to  the  College  of  the  Biscayunos,  a 
most  excellent  institution,  and  which  I  should  have 
much  regretted  leaving  Mexico  without  seeing.  The 
college  is  a  spacious,  airy,  and  handsome  edifice, 
modelled,  I  understand,  after  the  royal  palace  at 
Madrid.  The  founders  were  three  rich  old  Biscayans 
who  bethought  them  of  using  their  large  fortune  in 
this  charitable  manner.  The  college  is  for  the  benefit of  girls.  They  are  chosen  by  directors  or  trustees 
named  for  the  purpose,  and  the  preference  is  given 
in  election  to  those  of  Biscayan  birth  or  descent. 
When  once  elected  the  girls  are  taken  into  the 
college,  a  magnificent  and  extensive  building,  where 
they  receive  a  good  and  careful  education.  When 
grown  up  they  have  the  choice  of  three  things, 
namely,  to  marry,  to  go  into  a  convent,  or  to  stay 
where  they  are  as  teachers.  When  they  choose 
either  of  the  first  two  vocations,  they  are  dowried 
with  four  thousand  piastres.  The  internal  organisation of  the  establishment  is  curious.  They  are  divided 
into  little  governments  or  republics  consisting  of 
ten  members  in  each.  These  ten  possess  a  kitchen, 
a  salon,  and  a  dormitory  between  them.  They  do 
everything  for  themselves,  each  girl  in  rotation 
taking  her  turn  daily  at  the  different  employments. 
One  of  this  ""  council  of  ten  ""  is  appointed  president 
or  governor  for  a  month,  when  she  goes  out  of  office 
and  is  succeeded  by  another,  and  so  on.  The  system, 
I  understand,  works  admirably  in  every  respect.  On 
leaving  here  we  proceeded  to  the  Cathedral,  which, 
though  I  had  cursorily  visited  already,  I  wished  to 
go  over  again.  D'abord,  we  had  to  take  off  our 
bonnets  and  leave  them  in  the  carriage,  as  women 
are  not  allowed  to  enter  the  Mexican  churches  in 
either  bonnets  or  hats ;  so  we  substituted  scarfs  enveloping both  head  and  shoulders,  mantilla  fashion, 
and  so  entered.  The  interior  does  not,  at  least  now, 
correspond  with  the  grandeur  of  its  external  appearance ;  but,  like  many  other  things,  it  is  sadly  shorn  of 
its  ancient  glories.  There  is  still  a  great  deal  of 
silver  about  it,  and  the  pillars  near  the  high  altar  are 
curiously  enriched  with  many-coloured  marbles ;  but 
the  aisles  and  body  of  the  church  are  all  but  stripped, 
and  bear  visible  marks  of  popular  and  profane  touch. 
The  church  is  of  Gothic  architecture,  finely  shaped, 
and  of  immense  size.  Two  stately  towers  flank  the 
fapade  at  either  side.  Were  there,  however,  nothing 
attractive  either  in  sculpture  or  ornament,  the  Cathedral of  Mexico  must  always  possess  an  undying 
interest  for  the  antiquary,  and  indeed,  I  should  think, 
for  all  readers  of  history.  On  the  spot  now  hallowed 
by  the  Christian  church,  stood  once  the  temple 
dedicated  to  the  gods  of  the  most  revolting  and 
cruel  faith  that  ever  stained  the  annals  of  a  people 
since  the  creation  of  the  world, — the  Aztec  war- 
deity,  to  whom  this  temple  was  especially  devoted, 
and  in  whose  honour  whole  hecatombs  of  miserable 
human  victims  were  yearly  sacrificed.  The  present 
pavement  of  the  Cathedral  is  entirely  formed  of  the 
numerous  statues  and  busts  of  their  various  pagan 
deities,  notwithstanding  which  there  are  lots  still 
to  be  seen  at  the  Museum  and  elsewhere.  As 
we  left  the  building  our  attention  was  directed 
to  the  famous  Calendar  stone,  called  in  Mexican  slang 
""el  relox  de  Montezuma""  (Montezuma's  watch). 
In  the  days  of  the  Aztec  emperors  it  stood  in  the 
centre  of  the  Grand  Plaza,  but  has  since  been  transferred to  the  enclosure  by  the  Cathedral.  It  is  of 
circular  form,  and  of  great  size  and  weight  —  upwards 
of  fifty  tons,  I  am  told  —  and  is  inscribed  with  all 
manner  of  signs  and  hieroglyphics,  by  which  means 
they  formed  a  tolerably  accurate  computation  of  the 
lapse  of  time,  seasons,  &c.  Strange  that  such  civilisation  as  this  should  have  existed  at  the  same  period with  the  frightful  barbarities  before  mentioned  ! 
Being  now  in  proper  costume  for  church  visiting,  we 
took  the  opportunity  of  going  to  two  others — namely, 
San  Francisco  and  Santa  Clara.  The  former  is  one 
of  the  most  beautifully  ornamented  in  the  whole 
city.  Fine  sculptures  in  variegated  marble  are  to  be 
observed  all  around,  while  the  altar  glitters  with 
jewels  and  gold.  Santa  Clara  is  less  splendid,  but  in 
purer  and  better  taste ;  white  marble  columns  relieved with  gleams  of  gold  in  the  bas-reliefs.  We 
now  drove  a  few  miles  out  of  Mexico  to  see  those 
curious  relics  of  bygone  days  —  or  at  least  what  remains of  them  —  the  chinampas,  or  floating  islands. 
The  latter  term  is  certainly  now  a  misnomer.  They 
have  all  but  completely  attached  themselves  to  the 
continent  or  parent  soil.  In  two  or  three  instances 
only  a  kind  of  rivulet  or  stream  surrounds  them,  and 
allows  one  to  imagine  what  they  i>:ight  once  have 
been — flowery  sort  of  rafts  skimming  along  the  quiet 
surface  of  the  lakes.  I  should  suppose  that  the 
interwoven  aquatic  plants  which  originally  formed 
the  foundation  of  these  chinampas  must  have  thrown 
out  offshoots  and  branches  which,  in  process  of  time, 
encountered  others  from  the  mainland,  and  so  knit 
themselves  together  that  in  most  cases  the  residents 
on  the  soil  even  cannot  tell  where  the  mainland  ends 
and  where  the  islands  begin.  The  present  appearance  of  those  we  saw  resembled  patches  of  good  productive kitchen  garden,  but  lacked  the  wilderness  of 
flowers.  The  Museum  being  now  reopened,  we  went 
there  for  a  couple  of  hours  yesterday  morning. 
There  is  such  a  strong  family  likeness  in  all  museums, 
that  it  would  only  be  tedious  to  enumerate  any  portion of  the  contents  of  this.  Suffice  it  to  say,  therefore, that  here  are  the  usual  statues,  busts,  torsos,  &c., 
(f  supposed  to  be  ""  of  everybody ;  bits  of  gold,  silver, 
copper,  iron,  lead,  and  all  the  known  metals  ;  spitted 
scorpions,  centipedes  and  spiders,  pickled  snakes  and 
stuffed  monkeys ;  also  a  series  of  portraits  of  the 
Viceroys  down  to  the  days  of  the  Republic.  One 
natural  curiosity  there  is  worth  all  the  other  objects, 
in  my  opinion.  This  is  (( el  arbol  de  las  manitas,"" — 
Anglice,  the  tree  of  the  little  hands, —  a  most  extraordinary plant.  The  flower  is  red,  and  in  shape 
something  like  an  anemone ;  but  from  it  there  protrudes a  singularly  correct  and  well-formed  hand, 
the  only  difference  between  it  and  the  human  member being  that  this  possesses  five  fingers  besides  a 
very  perfect  thumb.  There  are  now,  I  am  told,  but 
two  specimens  of  this  plant  remaining  in  Mexico  or 
in  the  world,  so  that  it  is  no  matter  of  wonder  to 
find  it  honoured  by  a  place  in  the  Museum.  Hence 
we  proceeded  to  the  church  attached  to  a  charitable 
institution  called  the  Hospital  de  Jesus.  Here  was 
the  last  resting-place  of  Cortez,  if  indeed  the  term 
rest  can  be  applied  to  aught  which  has  undergone  so 
many  changes.  After  being  transported  from  Seville, 
where  he  died,  here  to  the  land  he  won,  his  remains 
were  successively  interred  in  three  different  places ; 
at  Tezcuco,  at  the  church  of  San  Francisco  in 
Mexico,  and  lastly  at  this  place,  ""  Jesus  of  Nazareth."" 
To  the  disgrace  of  the  Mexican  mob,  on  the  occasion 
of  the  popular  outbreak  in  1823,  they  broke  into  the 
church  with  the  intention  of  desecrating  the  tomb 
and  destroying  the  remains  of  the  hero,  but  for 
whose  life  and  deeds  of  bravery  and  perseverance 
these  wretched  miscreants  could  not  have  called  the 
""  Queen  of  the  Valley  ""  their  own  native  land.  Fortunately for  the  Mexican  reputation,  timely  warning 
was  conveyed  to  one  of  the  nobles  of  the  despicable 
project  of  the  rabble,  and  the  ashes  of  Cortez  were 
once  more  disinterred  and  conveyed  to  a  place  of 
safety.  But  where  that  is,  no  one  knows  but  the 
chief  actor  in  the  scene  and  his  family.  The  secret   
is  very  prudently  still  preserved,  as  the  general  good 
order  and  tranquillity  are  by  no  means  improving 
with  regard  to  Mexico  or  the  Mexicans.  In  the  evening we  attended  a  great  ball  given  in  the  Lonja  or 
Exchange  Eoom,  a  very  brilliant  affair.  Diamonds 
were  worn  to  an  amount  I  should  have  thought  incredible. I  was  chiefly  glad  of  this  ball  taking  place 
while  we  were  in  Mexico,  by  its  affording  me  an 
opportunity  of  seeing  and  having  time  to  examine 
the  President  Santa  Anna,  who,  with  his  young  wife, 
""  assisted  ""  at  the  fete.  They  were  both  seated  on 
chairs  of  state  raised  on  a  velvet-covered  platform, 
and  were  surrounded  by  the  staff,  ministers,  corps 
diplomatique,  officers,  &c.  He  is  a  sallow-complexioned,  careworn-looking  man,  and  no  wonder.  I 
should  think  his  life  anything  but  an  easy  or  an 
enviable  one.  He  gives  me  the  impression  of  being 
a  man  of  strong  determination,  not  easy  temper,  and 
whose  will  it  might  be  dangerous  to  thwart.  Madame Santa  Anna  is  young  and  pretty  —  reported 
beautiful,  but  this  I  think  an  exaggeration ;  at  least 
she  disappointed  me.  Her  complexion  is  pale,  eyes 
and  hair  dark,  features  tolerable ;  but  this  sort  of 
face  is  no  uncommon  one.  She  is  of  low  birth,  but 
has  had  the  virtue  to  accept  Santa  Anna's  addresses 
only  on  the  condition  of  becoming  his  wife.  She 
pays  the  usual  penalty,  however,  for  marrying  a  man 
more  than  double  her  age,  in  becoming  the  object 
of  his  ever  watchful  jealousy  and  suspicion.  The 
dancing  continued  till  nearly  five  o'clock  in  the 
morning,  principally  the  ""  Spanish  dances  ""  so  called, 
a  kind  of  slow  floating  movement  to  a  sort  of  Sir 
Eoger  de  Coverley  figure.  Waltzes  and  polkas  were 
occasionally  interspersed  ;  but  the  truth  is,  no  lungs 
can  stand  quick  motion  through  the  air  here,  whether in  running  or  dancing  or  any  positive  self-
exertion  of  body :  the  atmosphere  being  so  rarefied, 
one  turn  of  a  waltz  sets  every  one  panting  as  if  they 
had  got  the  asthma.  So  the  Spanish  dances  are  likely 
to  maintain  their  supremacy  on  a  stronger  ground 
than  the  caprice  of  changeable  fashion. "
24,"BEING  very  tired,  after  last  night's  dissipation,  we  con- 
tented ourselves,  this  afternoon,  with  a  ride  on  horseback a  few  miles  out  of  town,  where  we  were  quiet- 
spectators  of  a  very .  curious  scene,  viz.  a  sale  of 
horses,  which  had  to  be  caught  for  inspection  when 
chosen.  I  was  much  amused  and  interested  with  the 
whole  ceremony,  some  of  the  incidents  of  which  were 
most  laughable.  •  It  would  be  scarcely  possible  for 
an  uninitiated  person,  or  one  who  had  not  been  an 
eye-witness  of  the  performance,  to  understand  from 
a  description,  however  minute,  the  extraordinary 
skill  of  the  Mexicans  in  throwing  the  lasso.  I  think, 
perhaps  the  most  incomprehensible  part  is  the  apparent slowness  and  composure  with  which  it  gradually uncoils  on  its  route.  A  good  aim,  quickly  and 
suddenly  taken,  whether  with  a  stone,  a  ball,  or  anything else,  is  simple  enough ;  but  the  lasso,  to  all  appearance, aims  at  nothing.  I  repeatedly  saw — that 
is,  I  fancied  I  saw — the  treacherous  cord  unrolling 
itself  at  about  the  same  pace  as  the  horse  was  going.
keeping,  as  it  were,  alongside  of  him  until  the 
moment  decreed  by  fate  had  arrived.  Then  it  depended much  on  the  character  of  the  horse  what 
happened  afterwards.  If  he  was  of  a  philosophical, 
easy-going  turn,  his  pace  gradually  slackened,  and, 
without  any  violence,  he  was  brought  up  for  examination. If,  on  the  other  hand,  and  as  most  frequently happened,  he  resisted  the  indignity  of  being 
in  any  way  shackled,  he  speedily  measured  his  length 
on  the  ground;  yet  so  quietly  and  gently  withal,  that 
his  uppermost  feeling,  I  imagine,  must  be  astonishment even  more  than  rage.  It  is  certainly  an  exemplification of  the  old  saw  that  ""practice  makes 
perfect.""  The  men  here  practise  it  perpetually. 
The  lasso  is  an  indispensable  accessory  to  every 
saddle,  and  they  experimentalise  on  -everything.  Nothing comes  amiss.  Children,  too,  from  their  infancy, 
will  make  a  slip-knot  with  any  bit  of  string  they  can 
get  hold  of,  and  set  to  lassoing  their  chickens,  ducks, 
kittens,  puppies,  toys,  or  whatever  may  come  in  their 
way.  From  this  peculiarity,  as  may  be  supposed,  the 
existence  of  domestic  animals  does  not  flow  on  so 
easily  as  it  might  do.  I  have  often,  from  my  balcony 
here,  watched  and  laughed  at  the  distress  of  some 
maternal  hen,  and  the  clucking  indignation  of  pater- 
familias at  the  sudden  bereavement  of  one*  of  their 
progeny  by  the  whipcord  of  some  mischievous  urchin. 
The  trial,  to  be  sure,  is  of  short  duration  but  must
be  very  unpleasant  to  the  parties  concerned  for  the 
time  being.  I  have  also  profited  by  this  comparatively idle  day,  by  doing  a  little  Mexican  shopping ; 
that  is  to  say,  I  intended  to  do  so,  but  unfortunately 
I  find,  on  examination,  that  the  prices  of  the  articles 
I  particularly  desired  were  quite  beyond  my  portee. 
The  principal  object  of  my  ambition,  in  the  way  of 
personal  decoration,  was  a  genuine  Spanish  mantilla 
made  of  blonde,  either  black  or  white,  such  as  I  see 
les  grandes  dames  of  Mexico  are  in  the  habit  of 
wearing ;  but  on  selecting  one  which  pleased  me,  and 
inquiring  its  price,  I  heard,  to  my  consternation,  that 
it  amounted  to  200  dollars,  i.  e.  upwards  of  40L  So, 
as  anything  like  that  sum  was  out  of  the  question, 
I  ceased  to  think  any  more  about  it.  I  have,  how- 
ever, succeeded  in  obtaining  two  very  handsome 
specimens  of  the  Mexican  ""  serape,""  which  I  shall 
send  to  you  the  first  opportunity,  or,  if  none  presents 
itself,  I  shall  keep  and  bring  home  with  me.  They 
are,  at  all  events,  uncommon,  and  not  to  be  seen 
every  day.  The  only  thing  against  them  is,  that 
though  they  will  make  capital  railway  wraps,  and 
effectually  preserve  you  from  both  dust  and  cold, 
they  are  so  singular  in  form,  and  the  colours  so  many 
and  so  brilliant,  that  I  almost  fear  you  might  render 
yourself  liable  to  be  taken  up,  or  mistaken  for  the 
Pope  or  the  Sultan,  or  some  equally  mischievous 
person.  I  have  also  bought  two  or  three  silver 
brooches,  principally  used  by  the  Mexicans  to  fasten 
their  sombreros,  or  rather  the  feathers  or  ribands 
they  may  wear  in  them.  These  brooches  are  specially 
interesting  as  bearing  for  their  design  the  national 
emblem,  namely,  an  eagle  flying,  wings  extended, 
and  carrying  in  his  claws  a  large  branch  of  the  nopal  or 
prickly  pear.  These,  together  with  a  Mexican  riding 
whip  and  some  valentines  (oddly  enough,  they  have 
the  custom,  though  not  the  day,  here ;  and  whereas 
we  make  ours  the  14th  of  February,  they  make 
theirs  on  the  day  we  devote  to  geese,  the  29th  of  September), are,  I  think,  all  the  extravagances  of  which 
I  have  been  guilty.  This  letter,  I  see,  has  extended 
itself  to  a  most  unconscionable  length ;  therefore,  as  I 
do  not  wish  to  ruin  you  in  postage,  I  shall  now  conclude, and  remain 

Your  ever  affectionate

25,"Mexico,  Oct.  26th. — My  dear  Father, — This  will,  I  fear 
be  the  last  or  nearly  the  last  letter  you  will  receive 
from  me  dated  Mexico,  for  the  time  of  our  departure 
is  now  drawing  very  near.  The  actual  day  is  not  yet 
fixed,  as  it  will  greatly  depend  upon  circumstances, 
about  which  I  will  tell  you  when  all  is  finally  arranged and  I  know  myself  what  our  movements  will 
be.  Yesterday  we  went  to  Tacuba,  the  ancient 
Tlacopan,  and  the  spot  to  which  Cortez  retreated 
after  the  first  great  reverse  that  befel  the  Spanish 
arms  after  the  conquest.  We  followed  step  by  step 
the  same  path  taken  by  the  routed  troops  on  that 
""  noche  triste,""  or  sad  night,  and  lingered  for  a  few 
minutes  at  the  scene  of  the  famous  leap  of  Alvarado, 
who,  finding  himself  cut  off  from  all  hope  of  retreat, 
alone  against  countless  enemies,  took  the  desperate 
measure  of  planting  his  lance  firmly  in  the  bottom 
of  the  stream,  and  by  its  aid  swung  himself  across  a 
prodigious  distance  out  of  reach  of  his  assailants. 
There  is  at  Tacuba  now  a  small  field  with  some  old 
trees  and  flowering  rose-bushes.     Under  one  of  the 
former,  called  by  his  name,  Cortez  is  said   to  have 
passed    the    dark    hours    of  that   dreary   night.     I 
gathered  a  bunch  of  the  roses  to  keep  as  a  souvenir 
of  the  spot  for  my  own  satisfaction  ;  but  for  a  narration of  this  most  extraordinary  and  romantic  *  episode 
in  the  history  of  those  days,  it  would  be  the  height 
of  presumption  in  any  one  to  attempt  it  after  the 
account  given  in  the  incomparably  eloquent  pages  of 
Prescott.     Spent  the  evening  with  the  same  friends 
whom  we  visited  at  Tacuba  some  weeks  ago,  and 
who  have  now  come   into  Mexico   for   the  winter. 
Had  tea  a  V  Anglaise,  and  what  was  far  better,  at 
least  for  a  change,  chocolate  a   la  Mexicaine.      It 
would    be   impossible    to    imagine    anything    more 
delicious  in  its  way  than  chocolate  as  they  prepare 
it  in  this   country.     Without  of  course   instancing 
England,  where  by  asking  you   get  a  cup  of  what 
is  libellously  called  chocolate  and  in  taste  approximates to  toast  and  water  mixed  with  sky-blue  milk 
and  sweetened  with  syrup,  I  will  compare  the  chocolate 
here  with  what  is  given  you  in  France,  where  they 
flatter  themselves  they  understand  the  beverage ;  yet 
I  have  no  hesitation  in  saying  that  even  the  French 
know   nothing   about   the    matter.      In    the    more 
absorbing  attraction  of  other  incidents  of  our  journey 
between  Vera  Cruz  and    this   city,  I  find    I   have 
been  ungrateful  enough  to  omit  any  mention  of  the 
sustenance  afforded  us  by  the  chocolate,  always 
found  in  perfection  and  in  plenty  at  the  poorest  and 
humblest  huts  on  the  road.  I  remember  particularly, 
on  the  occasion  I  have  already  mentioned,  when,  in 
the  middle  of  a  cold,  rainy,  stormy  night,  our  diligence stuck  fast  in  some  of  the  deep  ruts  abounding 
in  the  way,  we  entered  what  appeared  to  be. nothing 
better  than  a  hovel  of  the  most  miserable  description. 
The  inside  did  not  either  at  all  belie  the  promise  of 
the  out.  In  one  room,  or  rather  portion  of  space, 
unpartitioned,  were  sleeping  a  man  and  woman,  two 
children,  two  goats,  a  pig,  a  parrot,  a  cat,  a  lot  of 
poultry  roosting  in  the  oddest  places,  and  dogs  ad 
libitum;  besides  dried  fruit,  vegetables,  meat,  &c., 
hanging  from  the  rafters  on  the  roof.  It  might  be 
naturally  supposed  that  in  a  place  of  this  description 
one  would  find  nothing  superexcellent  in  the  way  of 
cuisine;  and  yet,  within  ten  minutes  of  our  unlooked-for entree  in  their  cabin,  these  hospitable 
Indians  produced  a  potful  of  hot  chocolate,  the  like 
of  which  I  would  challenge  all  Paris  to  equal.  To 
return  to  our  friend's  soiree  after  this  digression  :  we 
occupied  our  evening  in  playing  vingt-et-un,  which,  by 
the  way,  is  the  general  nightly  amusement  here,  and 
much  more  resorted  to  than  dancing  —  I  suppose  for 
the  reasons  I  mentioned  in  describing  the  Lonja  ball. 
This  morning,  Eleanor  not  being  actively  inclined,  I 
rode  with  Mr.  Berkeley  to  San  Augustin,  a  village 
some  eight  miles  from  here,  which  is  actually  devoted 
to  no  other  purpose  than  that  of  gambling.  Curious 
country  and  still  more  curious  government,  where 
the  existence  of  such  a  state  of  things  as  an  institution is  permitted !  The  gambling  fetes  for  this  year 
are  over  now  (they  take  place  in  June) ;  but  though 
for  the  present  deserted,  my  cicerone  pointed  out  to 
me  the  various  houses  where  so  many  fortunes  change 
hands,  besides  describing  to  me  the  details  of  what 
takes  place,  he  having  been  a  visitor  annually  for 
some  time  past.  The  principal  and  favourite  game 
is  ""  Monte,""  which,  as  far  as  I  can  make  out,  differs 
very  little  if  at  all  from  Lansquenet ;  but  the  merry- 
making once  begun,  both  sexes,  all  ranks,  the  young 
and  the  old,  the  rich  and  the  poor,  crowd  to  San 
Augustin,  and  play  with,  against,  and  beside  each 
other.  I  am  sorry  to  add  that  the  affections  of  this 
heterogeneous  multitude  are  equally  divided,  or 
nearly  so,  between  Monte  and  a  far  more  inhuman 
amusement,  namely,  cock-fighting ;  the  slaughter  of 
these  poor  innocents  at  the  annual  fetes  amounts  to 
something  enormous,  the  fashion  of  fastening  sharp 
knives  to  their  spurs  preventing  any  chance  of  preserving their  lives,  with  very  few  exceptions.  An 
absurd  story  is  told,  and  I  believe  well  authenticated, 
of  the  President  Santa  Anna,  whose  excessive  love  for 
cock-fighting  once  led  him  into  most  irreverent  and 
uncourteous  behaviour  to  a  Mexican  bishop.  The 
latter  had  gone  to  call  on  Santa  Anna  by  appointment, but  the  conversation  had  scarcely  begun  when 
the  President  started  up  and  left  the  room.  The 
reverend  padre  waited  for  some  time  patiently,  then 
wonderingly.  At  length  he  rang  the  bell,  and,  in 
answer  to  his  inquiries,  was  told  that  Santa  Anna 
""  had  gone  to  visit  a  sick  friend.""  ""  Who  ?  ""  ""Silver- 
tail.""  ""Who  is  Silvertail?""  ""His  excellency's 
favourite  gamecock,  who  was  wounded  in  a  fight  this 
morning ! "" "
26,"October  28th.  —  This  is  our  very  last  day  in  Mexico, 
my  dear  Father.  I  therefore  yield  to  the  temptation 
of  dating  yet  one  more  letter  from  it,  though  pro-bably my  despatch  will  not  be  closed  till  we  are  some 
way  on  the  return  route.  We  shall  reach  Vera  Cruz 
some  days  before  the  steamer,  but  by  taking  our 
departure  now,  although  it  is  a  little  premature,  we 
shall  have  the  double  advantage  of  an  escort  the 
whole  way,  and  also  we  shall  enjoy  the  company  of 
our  friends  the  Eiberas.  Madame  de  Eibera  is  going 
to  Europe  with  her  child,  and  Monsieur  accompanies 
her  as  far  as  Vera  Cruz,  where  a  Spanish  man-of-war 
awaits  her  embarkation.  The  whole  of  this  afternoon 
has  been  occupied  in  preparations  for  our  journey  and 
in  receiving  numerous  farewell  visits.  ""We  have  found 
many  good  friends  here  from  whom  we  shall  separate 

with  great  regret Yesterday  morning 

at  a  very  early  hour  we  left  Mexico  on  an  expedition 
to  a  place  called  ""  El  Desierto,""  anglice,  the  desert. 
Why  so  called  it  would  be  difficult  to  determine,  for 
nothing  could  very  well  be  more  unlike  our  general 
notions  of  a  desert.  It  is  about  fourteen  miles  from 
Mexico.  For  the  first  time  I  thought  the  view 
to-day,  as  we  gradually  approached  our  destination, 
fully  equalled  the  description  of  the  valley  given  by 
so  many  chroniclers,  from  Cortez  to  Humboldt. 
Hills,  valleys,  lakes,  and  mountains  outvied  each 
other,  shining  under  a  purple  sky,  and  almost  realised the  dreams  of  the  olden  time.  We  left  our 
carriage  at  the  village  of  Toluca,  and  shortly  after 
commenced  the  ascent  of  a  steep  hill  leading  to  the 
""  desierto.""  It  was  formerly  a  monastery,  but  is 
now  used  as  a  glass  manufactory.  Every  step  we 
took  disclosed  views,  the  one  only  more  exquisitely 
beautiful  than  the  other.  Much  as  I  have  seen  to 
admire  and  to  enchant  in  this  wonderful  country,  this 
day's  excursion  has  surpassed  all.  It  was  decreed  by 
the  fates  that  we  should  not  return  without  an  adventure ;  for  we  had  no  sooner  begun  to  wend  our 
way  down  the  little  path  leading  back  to  Toluca,  than 
the  most  violent  storm  of  tropical  rain  that  can  be 
imagined  burst  over  our  heads.  It  really,  as  they  say 
in  Yorkshire,  ""  came  heaven  down.""  We  were  wet 
through  in  two  minutes ;  but  this  was  not  the  worst 
part  of  the  business.  The  ground,  which  had  previously been  parched  and  burnt  from  a  long  continuance of  dry  weather  now  became  so  slippery  with 
the  rain,  which  had  glazed  more  than  soaked  the 
soil,  that  it  was  quite  impossible  to  keep  one's  footing at  all ;  and  so  slipping,  sliding,  stumbling  and 
falling,  we  pursued  our  downward  course.  However, 
""  all's  well  that  ends  well ;""  we  did  arrive  at  last,  drove 
home,  and  happily  accomplished  our  expedition 
without  even  catching  cold.  This  morning  we  took 
our  last  ride  on  horseback;  went  to  see  the  tree 
hallowed  by  the  ""  noche  triste.""  . 

Puebla,  Oct.  29th. — I  resume  my  letter.  We  reached 
here  about  an  hour  ago.  We  had  to  get  up  at  a 
dreadful  hour  this  morning,  starting  at  four  o'clock ; 
cold  and  miserable,  and  so  we  bid  a  sad  farewell  to 
Mexico.  Our  companions  are  Monsieur  and  Madame de  Eibera,  their  little  boy,  and  a  wonderful 
old  woman,  upwards  of  seventy,  who  is  returning  to 
Spain  after  having  passed  her  whole  life  from  the 
age  of  sixteen  in  Mexico.  Some  one  of  her  relations- 
has  died  and  left  her  a  fortune  in  her  old  age.  So 
she  is  now  about  to  go  and  end  her  days  in  her 
own  country.  Not  a  wise  plan,  I  think,  as  she  is  far 
too  aged  to  find  old  or  make  new  friends  now  in  old 
Spain,  whereas  she  leaves  the  ties  and  associations  of 
half  a  century  behind  her.  Madame  de  Eibera  was 
nursing  with  tender  care  two  extraordinary  little  dogs 
of  the  Chihuahua*  breed.  They  are  at  present  only 
in  their  early  puppy-hood,  and  are  of  the  size  of  very 
small  kittens ;  but  their  full  growth  scarcely  attains 
that  of  a  common  domestic  cat.  Most  marvellous 
tales  are  told  concerning  the  manners  and  customs  of 
this  race  of  canines,  for  the  truth  of  which  of  course 
I  cannot  vouch,  knowing  nothing  of  the  matter.  They 
say  these  dogs  are  met  with  in  and  surrounding  the 
Chihuahua  part  of  Mexico ;  that  their  organisation 
is  a  sort  of  ""  United  States  ""  in  miniature,  only  that, 
with  the  quadrupedal  republic,  they  have  the  advantage of  a  ""  president  ""  to  each  state,  and  that  president 
is  —  a  rattle  snake  !  They  are  said,  nevertheless,  to 
live  in  a  state  of  exemplary  order  and  felicity,  a  kind 
of  Utopian  mixture  of  free  trade  and  protection,  the 
former  consisting  of  a  course  of  (s  trading  ""  carried  on 
by  the  dogs  in  a  manner  more  free  than  welcome,  and 
the  latter,  as  may  be  guessed,  afforded  by  the  snakes 
on  principles  which  Mr.  Cobden  himself  I  imagine 
would  accede  to.  Unlike  political  parties,  however, 
there  exists  honour  among  thieves  here.  The  dogs 
forage  for  the  snakes,  as  well  as  themselves,  and  the 
snakes  in  their  turn  defend  the  dogs  from  all  adversaries, and  do  not,  according  to  the  manner  of 
""  liberals  ""  and  ""  conservatives,""  desert  their  friends. 
Madame  de  Eibera's  little  charges  are  amusing  and 
affectionate  little  things,  not  old  enough  yet  to  have 
felt  any  filial  affection  for  their  formidable  parent. 
I  nursed  one  all  the  way,  it  having  ensconced  itself 
very  comfortably  in  my  neck,  between  my  bonnet  and 
cloak.  Among  other  methods  of  whiling  away  the 
long  hours  of  our  journey,  I  derive  great  amusement, 
besides  instruction,  in  the  Spanish  language  by  listening to  the  prattle  of  the  young  Ribera,  a  fine  merry 
child  of  about  seven  years  old.  True  Castilian  is  undeniably the  queen  or  empress  of  languages,  and  from 
the  lips  of  a  child  sounds  peculiarly  beautiful.  Soft, 
without  the  namby  pamby  drawl  of  Italian,  grand, 
without  the  harshness  of  German,  and  brilliant,  without the  sharpness  of  French.  One  expression  particularly amuses  me  in  this  little  fellow:  when  he 
differs  in  opinion  with  his  father,  or  means  to  remonstrate with  him,  he  exclaims,  in  such  a  dignified 
manner,  ""  Hombre  !  ""  It  is  a  very  common  Spanish 
expression,  and  means  a  great  deal,  though  its 
literal  translation  is  merely  ""  man !  ""  which  sounds 
odd  enough  from  a  child  to  his  father ;  but  it  is  equivalent to  a  long  English  sentence :  for  instance,  ""  But, 
my  dear  Sir,  I  assure  you,  you're  quite  wrong ;  only 
reflect  for  a  moment,""  &c.,  would  all  be  expressed  by 
the  Spanish  ""  Hombre  !  "" "
27,"PUEBLA. 

WE  have  passed  over  the  same  ground  as  in  coming, 
only  that  we  reached  here  earlier  in  the  day,  and 
consequently  have  had  an  opportunity  of  judging  a 
little  more  of  the  town,  which  is  remarkably  handsome, and  of  visiting  the  cathedral.  This  is  a  most 
beautiful  edifice,  far  superior  in  all  respects,  I  think 
(size  excepted),  to  that  of  Mexico.  The  church  was 
so  quickly  built  that  tradition  says  the  workmen 
were  helped  by  angels,  who  came  by  night  and 
advanced  their  work.  Hence  the  name  by  which 
Puebla  is  distinguished,  namely,  ""  Puebla  de  los 
Angeles.""  ...  A  few  hours  after  penning  the 
above  lines,  we  again  set  out  on  our  journey,  another 
night  and  part  of  a  day  bringing  us  to  Perote,  which 
looked  much  less  dismal  than  on  our  first  visit.  We 
had  the  loveliest  view  ever  since  daybreak  of  the 
two  Mexican  volcanoes,  and  towards  the  close,  in-  the 
glorious  light  of  the  setting  sun,  Orizava  burst  upon 
our  sight.  Next  morning,  in  due  course  of  time,  we 
reached  beautiful  Jalapa  again.  The  scenery,  trees, 
and  flowers  seem  to  me  even  more  wonderful,  if  possible, than  on  my  first  visit.  Nothing  I  have  ever 
seen,  heard,  or  read  of  has  equalled  this  in  colouring. It  is  quite  indescribable,  and  would  only  seem 
to  be  exaggeration  were  I  to  attempt  to  render  the 
impression  the  whole  scene  leaves  on  the  mind  and 
memory. 

We  remained  the  whole  day  at  Jalapa,  reserving 
the  uninteresting  Tierra  Caliente  between  it  and 
Vera  Cruz  for  traversing  at  night.  Having  refreshed 
ourselves  with  an  excellent  dejeuner  a  la  fourchette, 
we  took  a  long  walk  with  our  friends  into  the 
country,  and  returned  laden  with  floripundias  and 
roses.  On  our  way  back  we  entered  some  of  the 
cottages  scattered  around.  In  one  of  these  we  unexpectedly came  upon  a  most  interesting  group.  A 
picturesque-looking  young  Mexican  playing  the  guitar 
and  singing  to  his  lady- love  ;  she,  the  while  occupied 
in  twining  bright  flowers  in  her  hair!  I  thought 
those  days  of  romance  had  gone  by;  and  so  they  have 
in  the  mother  country,  since  ""  Cervantes  laughed 
Spain's  chivalry  away ; ""  but  here  they  are  less 
civilised !  Another  night  ended  our  land  journey 
without  any  accident,  and  brought  us  to  Vera  Cruz, 
whence  I  am  at  this  moment  writing  (Nov.  6th), 
having  arrived  here  three  days  ago.  We  have  had 
a  most  unexpectedly  pleasant  sojourn  at  Vera  Cruz. 
It  certainly  exemplifies  the  truth  of  the  proverb 
about  giving  a  dog  a  bad  name.  This  much  maligned 
town  has  the  reputation  of  being  dull,  dismal,  and 
disagreeable  in  every  respect,  and  we  anticipated 
spending  our  three  or  four  days  of  detention  about 
as  profitably  as  if  we  had  been  in  quarantine ; 
whereas,  thanks  partly  to  Mr.  GKffard  (the  consul), 
who  has  introduced  us  to  some  friends  of  his  residing 
here,  we  have  had  riding  horses  placed  at  our  disposition by  different  people  each  day,  and  have 
enjoyed  ourselves  exceedingly.  As  soon  as  the  town 
and  the  immediately  surrounding  sands  of  Vera  Cruz 
are  passed,  you  enter  into  the  most  charming  country 
scenery  in  the  world.  We  cantered  about  for  miles 
over  green  turf,  and  through  green  lanes  and  leafy 
glades  worthy  of  England  itself.  Indeed  I  was  quite 
forcibly  reminded  of  Wonersh,  only  that,  besides  all 
the  beautiful  green  verdure  to  be  seen  there,  flowers 
grow  here  such  as  England  dreams  not  of.  An  odd 
adventure,  which  might  have  proved  a  catastrophe, 
occurred  to  us  yesterday.  An  old  Mexican  gentleman, Senor  Gr ,  had  begged  to  be  chosen  purveyor 

of  our  steeds  for  the  day,  and  accordingly  at  3  o'clock 
two  magnificent  looking  horses  were  at  our  door. 
They  did  not  seem  pleased  at  our  mounting,  but  that 
we  thought  nothing  of,  and  all  went  well  till  we  were 
outside  the  town  gates,  on  the  sand-hills  immediately 
surrounding  them.  Here  our  horses  began  to  perform. Eleanor's  bolted  at  once,  and  she  threw  herself 
off,  very  fortunately  clearing  the  saddle,  and  as  she 
fell  on  soft  sand  was  not  hurt.  My  steed  meanwhile began  to  plunge  in  the  most  frightful  manner 
I  ever  saw ;  but  I  was  afraid  to  throw  myself  off,  so 
on  him  I  sat,  till,  suddenly,  the  saddle  turned  round 
and  I  fell.  By  great  good  luck  the  horse  made  a 
great  bound  off  without  touching  me,  so  I  was  quitte 
pour  la  peur ;  and  after  all  we  managed  to  get  our 
ride  not  on  these  bucephali,  but  on  a  couple  of  steady 
""  sage  ""  ponies  lent  us  by  some  one  else.  But  the 
cream  of  the  incident  was  this.  The  old  gentleman 
on  being  questioned  on  the  subject,  very  coolly  said, 
""  No  one  had  ever  mounted  these  horses  before,  but 
that  he  had  always  understood  it  to  be  a  matter  of 
indifference  to  English  women  what  ( wild  beasts '

letter  to  a  close,  though  we  shall  travel  to  Havana 
together ;  but  as  the  vessel  will  only  remain  there  a 
few  hours,  I  probably  should  not  have  time  to  write 
on  arriving  there.  So  adieu,

28,"Havana,  November  llth. — My  dear  Father,  —  We 
embarked  on  the  same  evening  on  which  I  closed  my 
letter  at  Vera  Cruz.  A  furious  ""  norte  ""  blowing,  I 
thought  we  should  have  been  swamped  several  times 
before  reaching  the  steamer.  The  waves  dashed  all 
over  us,  and  we  were  completely  drenched  when  we 
at  length  arrived.  The  gale  became  worse  as  the 
day  wore  on,  and  at  last  the  shore  boats  asked  a 
hundred  dollars  for  bringing  or  taking  any  one  from 
the  land  to  the  vessel  or  vice  versa.  These  ""  nortes"" 
or  northerly  gales  are  the  terrors  of  the  Mexican 
Gulf.  They  come  on  generally  without  any  warning, 
and  like  the  Provenpal  mistral,  they  last  either  three 
or  nine  days,  and  cause  for  the  most  part  great 
damage,  besides  doubly  adding  to  the  dangers  of  the 
Alacranes.  Unfortunately  our  gale  was  one  of  the 
nine  days'  duration,  consequently  we  have  had  a  long 
and  most  disagreeable  passage  —  rough  sea,  bad  ship, 
and  worse  accommodation.  The  Avon  is  the  name 
of  the  packet  and  as  far  as  I  have  yet  seen  it  is 
the  only  really  bad  and  uncomfortable  one  in  the 
West  India  service.  You  may  imagine  under  these 
circumstances  what  a  relief  it  was,  to  make  Havana  at 
last,  to  see  the  dear  old  ""  ace  of  clubs  ""  again  (i.  e.  the 
harbour  of  Havana  which  is  shaped  exactly  like  one), 
and  to  meet  our  good  Spanish  friends  once  more. 

1 5th.  —  Yesterday  evening  we  dined  at  the  Quinton  with  the  captain-general,  and  met  a  large 
party  of  hidalgos  and  official  grandees,  with  their 
senoras  and  senoritas ;  that  is,  in  more  humble  words 
than  the  grandiloquent  Spanish,  their  wives  and 
daughters.  I  suppose  it  is  in  consequence  of  so  little 
being  heard  or  known  in  general  society,  now-a-days, 
of  Spain  or  the  Spaniards,  so  few  names  now  rise 
to  the  surface  so  as  to  be  saved  from  the  waters  of 
oblivion ;  and  even  these  few  are  rarely  known  to  any 
but  the  small  party  constituting  the  creme  de  la 
creme  of  different  nations;  that  on  hearing  mentioned in  presentation  to  me,  those  of  Villa  Hermosa, 
Pinalves,  Fernandina,  Velasquez,  Alva,  Alvarez,  Ximenes,  &c.,  I  was  for  a  short  time  almost  bewildered, 
wondering  whether  I  had  gone  back  to  school  days 
and  was  brushing  up  my  history,  or  whether  I  had 
fallen  into  a  reverie  over  the  chronicles  of  the  Cid  or 
Don  Quixote.  It  was  all  real,  however,  and  a  most 
agreeable  and  sociable  party;  but  so  I  find  all 
General  Canedo's  are.  His  receptions  are  on  the  plan 
of  most  royal  levees  and  similar  ceremonies;  yet, 
strange  to  say,  here  in  Cuba  the  regal  or  vice-regal 
audiences  are  far  less  serious  affairs  than  a  private 
""  morning  call.""  With  the  captain-general,  when  you 
have  properly  gone  through  the  ceremony  of  making 
your  reverence  to  the  representative  of  Queen  Isabel, 
you  may  do  whatever  you  please,  walk  about,  change 
your  place,  in  short,  amuse  yourself  as  fancy  leads  you. 
But  with  the  Cuban  nobility  and  gentlefolks  it  is 
quite  another  affair.  I  remember  receiving  a  very 
strong  impression  on  this  subject  from  one  of  the 
first  visits  I  paid  in  Havana,  namely,  to  the  Count  and 
Countess  O'Reilly,  to  whom  Isturiz  had  ""addressed 
me.""  I  was  shown  into  a  large  barren-looking  room 
(but  from  the  windows  of  which  there  was  a  most 
heavenly  view),  the  only  furniture  which  was  visible 
—  and  that  most  alarmingly  so  —  being  a  dozen 
rocking  chairs  ranged  in  two  rows  opposite  each 
other.  La  Senora  Condesa  received  me,  seated  in 
one  of  these  machines,  and  placed  me  next  her.  By 
and  by,  in  walked  some  junior  members  (males)  of 
the  family;  they  planted  themselves  just  opposite,  and 
we  all  began  to  talk;  but  it  was  in  vain  to  try 
and  turn  the  conversation  to  some  less  engrossing 
subject  than  how  or  where  we  had  all  spent  our 
morning.  I  think  I  must  have  got  what  the  French 
call  an  attaque  de  nerfs.  At  last  I  remarked  on  the 
beauty  of  the  view,  the  flowers,  everything  I  could 
see ;  and  of  course  hoped  a  walk  on  the  terrace  would 
be  proposed.  But  nothing  of  the  sort ;  each  male 
who  came  in  seating  himself  on  one  side  and  each 
female  on  the  other,  till  we  must  all  have  looked 
like  a  pack  of  ghosts,  bowing  to  each  other. 
To  be  sure,  it  was  consolatory  to  be  told  everything 
they  possessed  was  mine,  and  entirely  at  my  disposition ;  yet  I  would  willingly  have  sacrificed  all  these 
possessions  ""  en  Espagne  ""  for  the  present  power  of 
pushing  away  my  rocking  chair  and  going  wherever 
the  spirit  impelled  me.  Having  now  been  here  some 
time,  and  having  had  opportunities  afforded  me  of 
gaining  a  thorough  insight  into  the  way  things  are 
socially  conducted,  I  understand  tolerably  well  the 
principles  on  which  visiting  is  carried  on.  A  call  is 
a  state  ceremony,  and  if  you  are  the  bearer  of  a  letter 
of  introduction,  the  greater  form  and  etiquette  with 
which  you  are  received,  the  greater  is  the  honour  they 
intend  thereby  to  show  you,  and  greater  the  compliment to  the  friend  who  introduces  you.  Of  course  this 
applies  to  the  Havanese  or  Spanish  only ;  other  people 
act  according  to  the  custom  of-  their  own  country, 
whatever  that  may  be.  The  excessive  formality, 
however,  of  which  I  have  been  telling  is  only  applicable 
to  the  first  visit  or  morning  call,  as  after  that  you  are 
generally  invited  to  the  evening  receptions  or  tertullias  given  by  most  of  the  Havanese  families  on  stated 
evenings.  Here  you  amuse  yourself  well  enough,  and' 
above  all,  as  you  please.  You  may  dance,  or  play 
on  the  piano,  or  play  at  cards,  or  at  petits-jeux.  At 
each  or  all  of  these  you  will  find  companions ;  or,  if 
you  are  in  a  savage  mood,  you  may  swing  in  a  rocking 
chair,  no  very  uncommon  occupation  either,  and  a  very 
decided  improvement  on  trying  to  keep  oneself  still 
on  the  edge  of  one,  as  befell  me,  as  I  have  narrated, 
on  my  first  state  visit  to  Countess  O'Eeilly.  To-night 
I  was  presented  to  one  of  the  great  dignitaries  of  the 
church,  namely,  the  Archbishop  of  Santiago  de  Cuba, 
who  bears  the  rather  singular  name  (at  least  to  my 
ears),  ""  Claret  y  Clara.""  When  I  was  a  child  I  used 
to  be  called,  by  way  of  a  diminutive  or  pet  name, 
""  Clara  Claretti,""  so  I  was  not  a  little  amused  at 
finding  the  Eeverendissimo  Padre  ""  answer  to ""  my 
name  reversed,  that  is,  ""  Claret  y  Clara ! ""  The 
minister  of  police  was  another  of  the  guests  who  attracted my  attention  and  wonder,  the  latter  from  his 
being  one  of  the  most  innocent  and  simple-looking 
individuals  I  ever  remember  seeing.  Nor  did  his 
manners  or  conversation  belie  the  expression  of  his 
face.  He  seemed  good  nature  and  benevolence  personified. Of  course,  all  this  may  be  assumed ;  if  so,  he 
is  a  consummate  actor.  But  I  can  scarcely  think  it ; 
and  if  he  really  is  as  kind-hearted  as  he  looks,  I  should 
not  exactly  think  him  qualified  for  the  trying  post 
of  Minister  of  Police  in  a  place  where,  owing  to  the 
secret  machinations  and  insidious  agents  of  the  United 
States,  always  at  work  to  sow  the  seeds  of  revolt,  or 
blow  the  faintest  spark  of  discontent  into  a  blaze,  it 
would  seem  imperatively  necessary  that  one  on 
whom  so  much  may  depend  vitally  affecting  the 
island  and  the  honour  of  the  Spanish  crown,  should 
be  no  mere  carpet  knight,  but  one  possessed  of  ""  the 
mind  to  will,  the  hand  to  execute.""  While  on  this 
subject,  i.e.  the  constant  plots  and  attempts  at  annexation carried  on  so  unblushingly,  though  happily 
hitherto  ineffectually,  by  the  American  filibusters,  I 
will  endeavour  to  give  you  a  slight  sketch  of  the 
principal  incidents  connected  with  the  memorable 
Lopez  expedition. "
29,"WHATEVER  difference  of  opinion  may  exist  regarding 
the  political  expediency  of  annexation,  or  whatever 
may  be  argued  on  the  one  side  or  the  other  of  the 
advantages  to  be  gained  by  America,  or  even,  as  advanced by  some  casuists,  ultimately  to  Spain,  there 
can  be  but  one  view  entertained  by  any  right  thinking or  even  commonly  honest  persons  with  respect  to 
the  course  adopted  by  the  States  in  this  unhappy  affair. It  must  redound  to  the  eternal  disgrace  of 
the  Americans,  of  those  at  least  who  were  the  movers 
or  promoters  of  the  scheme,  that  they  inveigled 
into  their  toils,  and  chose  for  their  tools — in  this 
atrocious  outrage  on  a  friendly  nation  —  not  grown 
men  who  knew  what  they  risked,  knew  what  they  did, 
and,  whether  for  good  or  for  ill,  were  prepared  to 
abide  the  issue ;  not  these,  but  young,  ardent,  enthusiastic boys.  In  some  instances,  mere  lads  of  fifteen 
and  sixteen  were  enticed  and  snared  away  from  their 
homes  to  join  in  this  nefarious  enterprise.  And  under 
whose  command  were  these  misguided  victims  placed? 
Under  a  hero,  a  man  of  honour,  a  man  of  even  ordinary good  faith  or  honesty  of  purpose  ?     No :    but 
under  the  orders  of  a  traitor,  a    renegade  soldier, 
false  to  his  colours  and  his  country,  a  broken  and  disgraced castaway  from  the  Spanish  army — General 
Narciso  Lopez !     To  trace  the  causes  which  influenced, 
and  which  afterwards  perhaps  mainly  contributed  to 
the   maturing  these   schemes,  and   their   disastrous 
results,  it  will  be  necessary  to  go  back  to  the  commencement of  the  year  1848.     The  French  Revolution,    which   had   hurled   Louis   Philippe   from   his 
throne,  had  not  only  convulsed  the  whole  of  Europe, 
but  had  greatly  added  to  and  lent  impetus  to  revolu- 
tionary and   democratic  principles  in  both  the  Old 
world   and  the  New.      To  the  demagogues  of  the 
United  States,  especially,  no  period  could  have  been 
more  propitious :  their  recent  annexation  of  Texas  had 
disclosed  to  them  the  sweets  of  stolen  goods  —  a  species 
of  pleasure  peculiarly  grateful  to  the  American  sense. 
Added  to  this,  some  cheap  and  easy  victories  which 
had  crowned  their  arms  in  the  Mexican  Eepublic 
rendered   their    acquisition    of    Cuba   an    ""  eternal 
necessity  ""  (as  a  Yankee  once  told  me  in  talking 
over  the  subject).     They  took  their  measures  accordingly.    To  set  the  press  to  work  to  write  inflammatory articles   in  all   directions,  was   of  course  easy 
enough ;    but  besides  this,  they  hired  a  number  of 
other  agents,  for  the  most  part  men  of  the  worst
character,  to  visit  the  island  in  the  guise  of  inoffensive strangers,  but  who  were  to  take  every  opportunity of  fomenting  any  discontent  which  might 
arise  from  natural  causes ;  to  sound  the  opinions,  and 
discover  the  weak  points  of  all  on  whom  they  might 
find  the  arts  of  seduction  would  tell :  in  short,  to 
arouse  the  passion  of  resentment  and  kindle  rebellion 
against  their  masters  in  all  who  were  misguided 
enough  to  listen  to  them.  One  of  the  first,  and 
certainly  the  most  important  of  the  proselytes  they 
gained,  was  the  famous  Lopez.  This  man  was  a 
native  of  Venezuela,  but  had  served  from  his  youth 
in  the  Spanish  army.  Even  after  the  declaration  of 
independence  by  that  state,  he  adhered  to  his  former 
allegiance,  and  by  his  own  request  became  a  naturalised subject  of  the  Spanish  government,  and  maintained his  rank  as  an  officer  in  the  army.  He 
was,  however,  a  few  years  previously  (in  1841) 
General  Commandant  of  the  Centre  of  the  Island 
and  Governor  of  Trinidad.  In  course  of  time  this 
was  relinquished,  on  his  being  appointed  President 
""  de  la  comision  militar""  of  the  whole  island, 
and  this  post  he  actually  held  in  1848,  being 
quartered  in  Cienfuegos  at  the  southern  -part  of  the 
country.  Here  took  place  the  beginning  of  the  end 
a  few  years  later.  Profiting  by  his  high  position, 
and  the  consequent  knowledge  he  possessed  of  the 
strength  as  of  the  weakness  of  the  government,  as
well  as  the  prestige  of  his  own  popularity,  which 
was  considerable,  he  commenced  the  formation  of 
a  plan,  which,  by  the  gradual  and  insidious  corruption 
of  the  soldiery  under  him,  and  the  judicious  expenditure of  American  dollars  in  bribes  and  other  modes, 
was  ultimately  to  lead  to  the  betrayal  of  his  trust 
and  the  delivery  of  the  island  to  the  United  States. 
But  the  old  saying,  ""  Treason  never  prospers,""  proved 
itself  true  in  this  instance,  as  in  many  others.  Information was  conveyed  by  some  unknown  hand  to 
the  then  Governor  of  Trinidad  of  the  conspiracy  and 
its  chief  promoter,  and  measures  were  promptly 
taken  for  the  arrest  of  Lopez  in  the  first  instance. 
He  too,  however,  received  timely  warning  and  succeeded in  escaping  to  the  States.  A  military  commission was  held  immediately,  at  which  all  circumstances connected  with  the  plot  were  discovered. 
It  had  not  then  spread  very  far,  nor  were  the  arrangements sufficiently  matured  to  cause  for  the  time 
being  many  fears  for  the  future.  Lopez  was  tried 
by  court  martial,  broken  and  disgraced  from  the 
army,  and  condemned  to  death  as  guilty  of  high 
treason  and  rebellion.  Thus  matters  stood  (with 
the  further  discovery  and  discomfiture  of  another 
though  less  important  combination  in  the  following 
November)  at  the  close  of  1848.  The  ensuing  year, 
1849,  passed  in  comparative  tranquillity,  disturbed 
only  at  one  period  by  the  news  of  a  society  being 
organised  in  Rhode  Island  for  the  old  story.  This, 
however,  was  publicly  discouraged  by  the  President 
of  the  United  States  (General  Taylor),  its  dispersion 
ordered  —  a  further  enactment  that  it  should  be  declared ""piracy,""  with  all  the  attendant  pains  and  penalties, in  whomsoever  should  make  any  fresh  attempts 
on  Cuba.  This  slight  interlude  of  peace  was  soon 
to  be  troubled:  1850,  which  had  dawned  auspiciously, 
was  speedily  to  be  shadowed  by  the  dark  cloud  of 
war  and  tumult,  and,  worse  still,  of  pestilence ;  and 
even  this  last  scourge  the  unfortunate  Cubans  owed, 
under  Heaven's  permission,  to  the  Americans.  During 
the  two  preceding  years  the  southern  portion  of 
the  North  American  continent  had  terribly  suffered 
from  the  ravages  of  cholera ;  yet,  thanks  to  the 
general  precautions  taken  all  over  the  island,  Cuba 
had  so  far  escaped  contagion.  Towards  the  close  of 
the  month  of  March  a  few  isolated  cases  only  pre- 
sented themselves  in  the  military  hospital  of  Havana, 
but  in  the  course  of  a  few  short  weeks  the  epidemic 
rapidly  increased,  and  by  the  middle  of  May  the 
mortality  had  attained  an  average  of  125  to  150 
a  day  in  Havana  alone.  It  was  in  this  deplorable 
state  of  affairs,  and  when  the  attention  and  energies 
of  all  were  directed  to  alleviating  the  sufferings  of 
the  sick,  and  warding  off  as  far  as  might  be  the 
approaches  of  disease  from  the  comparatively  small 
number  of  places  that  were  as  yet  unscathed,  that 
the  first  serious  invasion,  under  the  auspices  of 
Lopez,  was  accomplished.  On  the  19th  of  May 
he  surprised  the  town  of  Cardenas  just  before  day- 
break, and  effected  a  landing,  together  with  five  hundred companions.  It  seems  very  extraordinary 
that  Cardenas,  though  a  seaport,  and  possessing  a 
population  of  3500  souls,  should  have  been  indebted to  a  guard  of  seventeen  men  only  for 
the  first  desperate  resistance  the  invaders  encountered. They  fought  gallantly,  however,  though 
against  impossible  odds  ;  they  intrenched  themselves 
in  four  houses,  and  only  after  eleven  of  their  little 
band  being  killed  or  wounded,  and  the  houses  they 
had  barricaded  set  fire  to,  they  succumbed.  But 
they  had  already  succeeded  in  gaining  the  inestimable benefit  of  time.  The  obstinate  defence 
they  had  made  had  lasted  several  hours,  and  had 
enabled  a  few  sturdy  townspeople,  who  had  not  lost 
their  wits  with  alarm,  to  summon  assistance  from  the 
neighbourhood.  The  great  majority  of  the  inhabitants, I  am  told,  however,  were  so  horror-struck, 
partly  with  fear,  and  partly  with  surprise,  at  their 
morning  slumbers  being  thus  so  rudely  broken,  that 
they  became  as  if  paralysed,  and  either  barred  themselves up  in  their  own  houses,  leaving  the  public 
buildings  to  the  mercy  of  the  depredators,  or  else,  as 
occurred  in  many  instances,  fled  precipitately  into 
the  country,  leaving  all  their  property  to  its  fate. 
Succour  was  now  at  hand :  towards  the  close  of  the 
day  some  strong  reinforcements  of  regular  troops 
from  Matanzas  and  elsewhere  poured  into  the 
beleaguered  town.  These  were  also  aided  further  by  a 
small  band  of  the  neighbouring  peasantry,  who 
armed  and  placed  themselves  under  the  command  of 
the  regular  officers.  A  hand  to  hand  fight  now  took 
place,  which  resulted  in  the  total  rout  of  the  enemy, 
who  were  driven  back  in  confusion  to  their  boats, 
and  under  cover  of  the  night  made  good  their  escape, 
together,  unfortunately,  with  the  traitor  Lopez.  The 
next  morning  the  extent  of  injury  incurred  by  the 
town  was  verified,  of  which  it  may  truly  be  said,  it  is 
well  it  was  no  worse.  The  churches,  rich  houses 
and  public  buildings,  generally,  were  despoiled  of 
whatever  ornaments,  or  objects  of  value  they  contained. Moreover  Lopez,  ""  qui  s'y  connaissait,"" 
contrived  to  ""  abstract ""  a  considerable  quantity  of 
money  from  the  custom  house  and  the  Fondo  de  las 
obras  Publicas  (an  establishment  answering  to.  the 
French  Hotels  de  Villes),  both  of  which  edifices  he 
completely  ransacked.  The  news  of  the  attack,  and 
its  signal  defeat,  was  now  quickly  conveyed  to 
Havana.  The  people  concerned  seemed  to  have  been 
too  busy  to  think  of  taking  or  sending  any  information at  the  time ;  at  least,  it  was  certainly  not  known 
in  Havana  till  the  next  day,  and  then  singularly 
enough,  almost  simultaneously  with  the  Cardenas 
history,  there  entered  the  harbour  a  Spanish  war- 
steamer,  called  the  Pizarro,  commanded  by  a 
Captain  Armero,  bringing  with  him  between  fifty 
and  sixty  prisoners  he  had  fished  up  in  Yucatan. 
They  gave  this  account  of  themselves :  that  they  had 
started  with  Lopez,  intending  to  join  in  the  attack 
on  Cardenas,  but  had  repented  en  route,  and  consequently had  been  set  on  shore  in  Yucatan  and  left 
to  their  fate.  Sad  and  melancholy  as  was  the 
general  aspect  of  Havana  at  this  time  of  disease  and 
trouble,  the  intelligence  of  this  double  event,  caused 
an  universal  and  spontaneous  demonstration  of 
enthusiasm  and  goodwill  to  the  government.  The 
prisoners  brought  in  the  Pizarro  were  mostly 
liberated,  with  the  exception  of  three  or  four,  but 
who  afterwards  received  a  free  pardon  from  the 
Queen.  On  the  old  principle  of  shutting  the  stable- 
door  when  the  steed  was  stolen  (which  proverb  by 
the  bye  is  of  Spanish  origin)  measures  were  now 
taken  throughout  the  island  for  an  organised  system 
of  defence.  No  great  difficulty  certainly  presented 
itself.  In  an  incredibly  short  time,  upwards  of 
13,000  men  enrolled  themselves  in  the  volunteer 
service  of  the  Government;  3000  muskets  were 
distributed  by  the  Captain- General  in  Havana,  and 
the  remaining  10,000  volunteers  were  formed  into 
four  battalions  which  were  variously  distributed 
about  the  country.  The  style  and  title  of  ""  Nobles
Vecinos "" were  given  them.  There  were  hopes 
now  entertained  that,  tired  and  discouraged  by  the 
successive  failures  which  had  been  their  lot,  the 
filibusters  would  at  last  give  way,  and  Cuba  be  left 
in  peace.  To  a  certain  extent  these  hopes  were 
fulfilled ;  a  little  breathing  time  at  least  was  enjoyed. 
In  the  meanwhile  the  governor  of  the  island  was 
relieved  from  the  post  he  had  filled  during  this 
troubled  period.  He  was  succeeded  by  Greneral 
Concha,  one  of 'the  most  popular  captains-general, 
from  all  accounts,  that  have  ever  wielded  the  vice- 
regal sceptre  here.  For  his  administration  was 
reserved  the  honour  of  defeating  the  last  and  most 
important  attack  yet  made  by  the  Annexation  party, 
of  crushing  for  ever  the  career  of  Lopez  and  the  few 
Spanish  adherents  he  had  gained,  and  this,  notwithstanding the  success  which,  for  the  first  three  days, 
attended  them;  and  finally  of  reading  a  lesson  to  the 
Americans,  which  it  is  to  be  hoped  will  not  be  lost 
upon  them,  teaching  them  how,  by  their  unconquerable love  of  wrong  and  robbery,  they  have  not  only 
delivered  over  to  famine,  disease,  imprisonment,  and 
death, — inglorious  and  shameful  death,  —  the  numbers of  brave  and  thoughtless  boys,  the  account  of 
whose  sufferings  forms  one  of  the  most  painful  episodes 
in  this  sad  history ;  but  they  have  lowered  themselves 
in  the  estimation  of  mankind,  disgraced  the  stars  and 
stripes  in  the  eyes  of  surrounding  nations.  Yes, 
(e  repudiate ""  as  they  may,  they  have  connived  at 
and  allowed  that  flag  to  afford  protection  to  as 
desperate  a  gang  of  pirates  and  banditti  as  ever 
crossed  a  sea  or  devastated  a  land.  I  am,  however, 
rather  forestalling  events,  and  must  now  endeavour 
to  relate,  in  their  proper  order,  the  various  incidents 
as  they  occurred,  from  the  first  alarm  being  sounded 
in  the  summer  of  the  year  1851. "
30,"ON  the  llth  of  August  of  that  year,  Lopez  disembarked at  a  place  called  El  Morrillo  near  Bahia 
Honda,  a  short  distance  to  the  west  of  Havana.  His 
force  amounted  on  this  occasion  to  about  450,  but 
nearly  half  of  these  consisted  of  the  youthful  victims 
I  have  before  alluded  to.  He  directed  his  steps  in 
the  first  instance,  with  about  300  of  his  followers,  to 
the  little  village  of  Las  Pozas ;  the  remaining  portion of  them  being  left  in  charge  of  the  baggage  and 
provisions,  with  orders  to  join  themselves  to  the 
main  body  at  the  earliest  opportunity  consistent  with 
safety.  Meanwhile,  unlike  the  former  occasion,  the 
news  had  spread  like  wildfire,  and  in  as  short  a  space 
of  time  as  circumstances  would  allow,  seven  companies 
of  infantry  under  the  command  of  General  Ena  embarked from  Havana  and  reached  the  scene  of  action, 
or  I  should  rather  say  approached  it,  as  for  a  short 
period  they  halted  at  Morrillo  to  reconnoitre  the  state 
of  affairs.  In  talking  over  these  things  now,  quietly 
and  at  a  distance,  I  am  told,  by  those  who  are  considered competent  to  pronounce  a  judgment,  that 
General  Ena  made  a  great  mistake  in  not  taking 
more  time ;  that,  seeing  how  things  were,  and  that 
Lopez  had  been  enabled  during  the  long  day  of  the 
12th  of  August  to  most  importantly  improve  and 
strengthen  his  position,  having  managed  by  means  of 
trenches,  mounds,  parapets,  &c.  to  establish  a  sort  of 
fortification ;  Ena  should  have  sent  for  more  help, 
and  also  some  guns  from  Havana,  instead  of  risking 
an  attack  under  these  disadvantageous  circumstances. 
Unfortunately,  he  seems,  however,  to  have  been  a  man 
of  more  daring  and  courage  than  reflection  ;  and  accordingly, without  waiting  for  what  prudence  might 
have  counselled,  he  ordered  an  impetuous  assault  in 
the  evening.  To  add  to  the  unfavourable  chances,  his 
men  were  already  tired,  hungry,  exhausted ;  they  had 
had  neither  rest,  food,  nor  drink  since  their  disembarkation and  had  waited  under  arms  during  the 
whole  night  of  the  12th.  Early  on  the  morning  then 
of  the  13th  (having  marched  from  Morrillo)  was  the 
word  of  command  given,  and  without  one  single 
piece  of  artillery  with  which  to  return  the  enemy's 
fire  (who  had  well  provided  themselves  with  field 
pieces),  and  faint  in  body  though  not  in  spirit,  they 
made  a  .gallant,  but,  as  may.  be  supposed,  fruitless 
effort.  The  village  of  Las  Pozas  being  built  something in  the  form  of  a  two-pronged  fork,  the  besiegers  had  to  divide  themselves  into  two  separate 
parties,  and  as  these  were  composed  of  only  two 
companies  each  (the  remaining  three  being  left  as  a 
corps  de  reserve  at  Morrillo),  little  damage  was  done 
to  the  besieged.  After  some  desperate  fighting,  Ena 
and  his  band  were  forced  to  retire  ;  their  retreat  was 
however  most  admirably  managed,  and,  as  it  happened, was  the  means,  thanks  to  the  perfect  discipline and  order  maintained,  of  half  retrieving  the 
fortune  of  the  day.  Lopez  trusting  to  the  prestige 
of  this,  his  first  and  most  unlooked-for  success, 
ordered  a  sortie,  and  an  attack  to  be  made  in  the 
rear  of  the  retreating  Spaniards.  This  was  a  bad 
enough  move ;  the  Royal  troops,  having  retreated 
in  unbroken  order,  now  faced  about ;  a  furious  hand- 
to-hand  fight  ensued,  which  ended  in  upwards  of  a 
hundred  of  the  enemy  being  left  dead  or  wounded  on 
the  field.  While  these  events  were  taking  place  at 
Las  Pozas,  the  remaining  three  companies  of  the 
Spanish  soldiery,  under  the  command  of  Colonel 
Villaoz,  who  had  remained  in  reserve  at  Morrillo,  had 
fallen  upon  the  commissariat  and  baggage  parties  of 
the  filibusters,  and  obtained  a  signal  success.  These 
last  consisted  of  nearly  180  men  and  boys.  They 
were  totally  defeated  and  put  to  the  rout :  more  than 
half  were  killed  and  wounded  on  the  spot;  about 
forty  succeeded  in  reaching  the  sea  and  embarking 
in  boats,  by  which  means  ten  or  twelve  perhaps  accomplished  a  safe  passage  to  the  United  States ;  the 
remainder  were  caught,  made  prisoners,  tried  by 
court  martial  and  shot,  poor  wretches,  with  very 
little  ceremony  at  Havana  within  a  few  days  of  their 
flight.  Their  fate,  miserable  as  it  was,  however, 
must  be  considered  more  fortunate  than  much  that 
was  in  store  for  some  other  of  their  fellow-conspirators in  this  eventful  and  ill-starred  expedition.  By 
his  imprudent  sortie  from  Las  Pozas,  and  the  severe 
check  he  there  encountered,  Lopez  had,  though  late, 
taken  warning ;  and,  profiting  by  his  past  experience, 
he  now  decided  on  a  sort  of  guerilla  mode  of  warfare, 
by  which  he  hoped  to  hold  on  until  he  had  regathered  and  to  some  extent  reorganised  his  scattered 
force.  With  this  intention  he  evacuated  Pozas  the 
same  day,  and  its  terrified  inhabitants  might  have 
returned  to  their  homes  ;  but  they  had  already  wandered away  far  and  wide,  thinking,  very  reasonably, 
that  the  marauders  were  unlikely  to  have  left  anything but  desolation  behind  them  Lopez  now  retired to  the  hills  and  fastnesses  abounding  in  the 
Cordillera  or  mountain  chain  of  the  Vuelta  Abajo. 
Here  the  natural  difficulties  in  the  way  of  attack, 
facilities  for  defence, — the  character  of  the  country 
rendering  it  inaccessible  to  cavalry,  while  immense 
rocks  seeming  as  if  they  had  suddenly  sprung  from 
the  ground  on  purpose  to  afford  safe  ambuscade  to 
brigands  of  everv  description, —  might  have  well 
enabled  a  guerilla  leader,  who  possessed  the  sympathies and  goodwill,  or  even  who  had  not  incurred 
the  opposition,  of  the  dwellers  on  the  soil,  to  maintain 
himself  against  all  aggression  for  months  or  even 
years.  But  this  was  not  the  good  fortune  of 
Lopez.  He  had,  on  the  contrary,  provoked  the 
hostility  and  let  loose  the  indignation  of  all  classes 
against  him.  The  homes  he  had  burnt  and  destroyed, the  lands  he  had  ravaged  and  laid  waste, 
the  blood  he  had  shed  or  caused  to  be  shed  of  the 
unoffending  and  helpless  peasantry  on  whom  he  had 
descended  like  a  thunder-bolt,  the  havock  and  ruin 
which  everywhere  marked  the  traces  of  his  path',  had 
armed  every  man's  hand  against  him :  there  were  none 
to  help,  there  were  all  to  oppose.  Whatever  he  succeeded in  obtaining,  whether  food  or  aught  else,  was 
by  violence  or  theft.  Nothing  was  given,  nothing 
sold  to  him.  War  to  the  knife  was  the  general  and 
universal  sentiment  aroused  in  the  hearts  of  all,  and 
so  the  catastrophe  was  gradually  approaching.  Long, 
long  after  these  events  had  passed  and  gone,  things 
began  to  ooze  out  little  by  little,  which  showed  how 
miserably  the  majority  of  these  unlucky  Americans 
must  have  been  deceived,  deliberately  and  systematically misled  from  the  very  beginning  of  the  enterprise. 
They  were  positively  assured,  and  were  shown  letters 
purporting  to  come  from  the  heads  of  the  principal 
families  in  Cuba,  as  well  as  from  officers  high  in  the 
army,  that  the  whole  island  was  prepared  to  rise  to  a 
man  to  shake  off  the  Spanish  dominion;  that  parties 
were  organised,  plans  of  action  laid,  a  period  of  simultaneous action  prepared  and  made  ready,  for  which 
the  signal  was  to  be  the-  landing  of  Lopez  and  his 
band :  in  short,  that  from  every  fort  and  tower  the 
flag  of  Castile  and  Leon  was  to  be  struck,  and  the 
triumphant  ""Stripes  and  Stars""  unfurled  in  its  place! 
How  such  absurd  trash  should  have  been  believed  for 
one  moment,  and  much  more  acted  upon,  by  even  the 
youngest  and  most  credulous  of  their  number,  has 
never  been  made  very  clear  ;  but  of  the  misrepresentation by  which  they  were  deluded,  there  is  no  doubt. 
To  return  to  my  narrative  :  the  position  of  the  enemy 
being  known,  and,  thanks  to  the  unwavering  fidelity 
and  loyalty  of  the  country  people,  General  En  a  and 
his  officers  being  made  acquainted  with  every  movement attempted  or  carried  into  effect  by  the  invaders, 
some  fresh  detachments  of  troops  having  been  now 
supplied,  the  General  proceeded  to  form  a  cordon 
round  that  part  of  the  Cordillera  which  sheltered  the 
insurgents,  so  as  to  effectually  close  up  all  avenues  of 
retreat,  and,  to  a  great  degree,  any  possibility  of  changing their  quarters.  The  consequence  of  this  line  of 
action  became  soon  apparent.  Want  of  provisions 
soon  forced  Lopez  to  send  a  foraging  party  from 
their  lurking-place  to  seek  food,  or,  indeed  I  should 
more  correctly  say,  his  whole  body  sallied  forth  for 
this  object.  They  had  advanced  as  far  as  a  Cafetal 
or  Coffee  Plantation,  called  ""  El  Cafetal  de  Frias,"" 
where  they  were  attacked  by  the  Eoyalist  regiments, 
commanded  by  Greneral  Ena  in  person.  What  the 
ultimate  result  of  this  engagement  might  have  been 
under  other  circumstances  it  is  impossible  to  say,  but 
the  conflict  had  scarcely  begun,  indeed,  the  general 
firing  had  not  commenced,  when  the  ill-fated  Ena, 
who  had  ridden  to  the  front  in  order  to  give  some 
directions  about  the  maneuvering  of  his  men,  received 
a  ball  in  his  chest,  and  immediately  dropped  from  his 
horse.  He  was  instantaneously  carried  to  the  rear,  and 
some  faint  hopes  were  entertained  that  the  wound  might 
not  prove  mortal ;  but  all  in  vain,  and  he  breathed 
his  last  on  the  field  where  he  lay.  This  unlooked-for 
disaster  spread  such  consternation  among  the  Spanish 
troops,  that,  had  the  rebels  taken  the  advantage  they 
might  have  done  at  the  sudden  shock,  almost  amounting to  a  panic,  which  seized  their  opponents,  they 
might,  at  least  in  the  first  hours  of  confusion,  have  
gained  some  immediate  if  not  permanent  success.  It  is 
doubtful,  however,  whether  they  knew  what  had  really 
occurred,  until  some  time  after ;  but  it  is  certain  that, 
instead  of  advancing  or  even  holding  the  ground  they 
possessed,  they  made  a  precipitate  and  somewhat 
disorderly  retreat,  but  were  unpursued ;  so  that  this 
eventful  day  of  the  seventeenth  of  August,  which  at 
its  commencement  was  supposed  to  herald  something 
decisive  on  one  side  or  the  other,  left  matters  on  the 
contrary  much  as  they  were,  the  loss  of  the  unfortunate General  Ena  only  excepted.  The  intelligence 
of  his  death  caused  universal  regret  in  Havana,  where 
he  was  respected  in  his  public  and  loved  in  his 
private  character.  The  highest  honours  were  paid  to 
his  remains  on  their  reaching  Havana,  whence  they 
were  conveyed  on  board  ship,  and  carried  to  his 
native  land  for  interment.  Yet  a  few  more  days,  and 
the  last  hopes  of  the  invaders  were  destroyed,  and 
the  star  of  Lopez  set  for  ever.  The  second  in 
command  after  General  Ena,  Colonel  Elizalde,  came 
up  with  them  at  a  place  called  Candillaria,  and  a 
sharp  engagement  took  place,  when  they  were  totally 
routed.  There  now  remained  but  a  hundred  followers of  Lopez  out  of  the  number  he  had  brought 
into  this  disastrous  undertaking,  and  these  few  were 
in  their  turn  encountered  on  the  24th,  dispersed  and 
scattered  far  and  wide.  And  now  began,  for  these 
unfortunate  victims  of  the  criminal  ambition  of  Lopez, 
a  series  of  hardships  and  miseries,  the  recital  of 
which  would  seem  rather  to  belong  to  the  pages  of  a 
romance,  than  to  be  mere  matter  of  actual  fact.  For 
many  a  long  day  and  weary  night  did  the  wretched 
remnant  of  the  invaders  wander  in  the  denies, 
the  woods,  and  the  wilds  of  this  unknown  and 
to  them  inhospitable  land,  seeking  shelter  in  caves, 
in  holes,  in  trunks  of  old  trees;  without  food, 
almost   without    covering ;    that    which    they    originally wore  having   been  torn   from   their   bodies 
by  the  tangled  thorns  of  the  creepers  and  parasites 
through  which  they  had  to  make  their  way  in  their 
precipitate  flight ;  their  flesh,  too,  torn  and  bleeding 
from  the  rude  contact  of  the  prickly-pear  abounding 
throughout    the   Cordillera ;    forced   to   satisfy   the 
craving  of  hunger  by  eating  the  berries  and  even 
leaves  of  trees;  in  danger  from  reptiles  and  their 
poisonous  bites ;  and,  finally,  tracked  surely,  if  slowly, 
by  the  far-famed  Cuba  bloodhounds.     Their  state 
was  indeed  lamentable.     How  often  did  they  bewail 
the  day  they  yielded  to  temptation !     As  may  be 
readily  supposed,  many  of  the  young  and  tenderly- 
reared   among   them   sunk   and   died   under    these 
accumulated  sufferings  and  privations.     Of  the  500 
who  made  good  their  landing,  about  170  escaped 
with  life  and  were  gradually  caught,  secured,  and 
imprisoned  in  Havana.     Here  they  remained  some 
time,  and  were  at  least  fed,  clothed,  and  their  wounds 
tended.     It  might  have  been  better,  as  things  turned 
out  after  all,  if  they  had  in  the  first  instance  given 
themselves  to  the  authorities,  and  trusted  to  their 
clemency;   but  as  they  all  lay  under  sentence   of 
death  when  caught,  a  proclamation  to  that  effect 
having  been  issued  the  day  after  the  landing  of  the 
expedition,  they  probably  and  naturally  supposed, 
after  such  repeated   provocations,  that  no  quarter 
would  be  given  them.  The  terrible  misery  they  had 
undergone,  however,  added  to  their  youth,  and  the 
obvious  deceit  of  which  they  had  been  victims,  were 
considered  as  sufficient  expiation  for  their  misdeeds. 
The  pain  of  death  was  remitted ;  and,  after  a  com- 
munication of  the  circumstances  to  the  government 
in  the  mother-country,  Queen  Isabel  granted  them  a 
free  pardon,  and  they  were  shortly  after  permitted 
to  return  to  the  United  States,  cured  for  life,  it  is  to 
be  hoped,  of  filibusterism.  .  .  . "
31,"IT  only  remains  now  on  this  subject  to  recount  the 
fate  of  Lopez  ;  though  this,  being  one  of  the  salient 
points  in  the  history  of  the  troubles  attending  Spain 
at  this  period,  is  tolerably  well  known.  After  his 
final  defeat  on  the  24th  of  August,  he,  with  seven 
only  of  his  companions,  fled  to  the  fastnesses  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  Vuelta  Abajo.  Four  experienced 
bloodhounds  were  placed  on  his  track,  aided  by  some 
soldiers  to  follow  them.  The  glory  of  capturing 
him  fell  to  the  lot  of  a  volunteer  after  all — a  farmer, 
I  believe,  of  the  name  of  Castaneda.  The  blood- 
hounds had  traced  him  to  a  gorge  in  the  rocks  of 
Eosario,  where  his  human  pursuers  came  up  with 
him.  He  was  secured,  and  brought  into  Havana  by 
his  captor,  Castaneda.  Small  space  was  allowed  him 
for  any  of  this  world's  affairs.  Since  1848,  sentence 
of  death  had  been  hanging  over  him;  but  had  he 
been  taken  then,  it  is  supposed  he  would  at  least 
have  met  with  a  soldier's  doom,  and  been  shot ;  but, 
as  it  was,  he  was  condemned  to  die  the  death  of  a 
felon:  and  so,  on  the  third  day  after  his  capture, 
on  the  1st  of  September,  he  was  garotted  on  the 
Esplanade   by   the  Morro.      A   shocking   sounding 
and  still  more  shocking  looking  mode  of  execution 
(judging  from  the  instrument,  which  I  have  seen), 
yet  it  is  far  more  instantaneous  in  its  effect  than 
our  fashion  of  hanging.     And  so  ended  the  eventful 
career  of  Lopez,  and  ends  my  narration  of  it,  which 
has  extended  itself  to  a  somewhat  greater  length 
than  I  anticipated  when  I  began  writing  it.     Though 
necessarily  imperfect  in  some  of  its  details,  from  the 
time  which  has  elapsed  since  these  events  took  place, 
besides  not  having  been  on  the  spot  then  to  hear 
them   commented  on  as  they  occurred,   I  may  at 
least  hope  to  establish  a  claim  to  one  merit  in  my 
relation,  namely,  truth.     The  preceding  account  has 
been  gathered  from  men  of  different  opinions,  and 
who   consequently   looked   upon    these   occurrences 
from  different  points  of  view;  yet  all  have  in  the 
aggregate  agreed,  not  only  as  to  the  facts,  but  with 
little  exception  as  to  the  guiding  causes  of  the  actions 
which  took  place.     Much  I  have  learned  from  the 
Captain-General ;  and  this  might  be  deemed,  therefore, by  those  unacquainted  with  General  Canedo's 
punctilious  sense  of  honour,  a  one-sided  statement ; 
yet  to  all  who  have  had  the  opportunity  of  knowing 
him,  I  need  say  nothing  further  in  corroboration  of 
the  truth  of  any  words  uttered  by  him ;  and  to  those 
who  have  not  known  him,  I  say  merely,  ask  those 
who  have.  Another  person  to  whom  I  am  indebted 
for  much  valuable  and  reliable  information  concerning the  events  which  marked  those  days  of  agitation, 
is  a  countryman  of  my  own,  Mr.  Sidney  Smith. 
This  gentleman,  at  the  time  of  Lopez's  invasion,  was 
secretary  to  the  English  Consulate  at  Havana,  and 
was  what  I  call  on  the  other  side ;  that  is,  his  com- 
passion and  sympathies  were  aroused  on  behalf  of 
the  Americans :  I  do  not  mean  in  the  first  instance 
of  their  invasion,  but  after  the  catastrophe  had  occurred, and  the  sun  which  had  risen  so  brightly  in 
Bahia  Honda  had  set  in  the  prison  of  Havana.  He 
then  did  all  that  mortal  man  could  do  to  alleviate 
their  sufferings,  and  to  soften  the  hardships  of  their 
confinement.  Indeed,  I  am  afraid  his  kind  heart 
would  have  prompted  him  even  to  endeavour  to  save 
Lopez  himself  from  the  garotting  he  so  richly  deserved. At  any  rate,  Mr.  Smith  devoted  himself 
entirely  to  these  poor  prisoners.  He  gave  them 
money  to  procure  better  food  for  the  sick  and  ailing ; 
he  gave  them  sympathy;  and,  better  than  all,  he 
gave  them  his  time.  He  wrote  to  their  parents  and 
friends  to  tell  them  all  that  might  be  told;  and 
many  a  mother's  heart  he  gladdened  by  letting  her 
know  that  her  child  was  at  least  in  life.  Finally, 
by  his  unwearying  patience  and  indefatigable  exertions, he  succeeded ;  and  I  do  not  think  I  am  saying 
too  much  when  I  attribute  to  his  indomitable  and 
persevering  efforts  (at  least  to  a  very  considerable 
extent),  the  ultimate  pardon  and  freedom  granted 
to  the  remnant  of  the  band.  The  people  in  the 
United  States  who  were  connected  with  and  concerned in  these  affairs,  I  know,  share  this  opinion ; 
apropos  of  which,  before  finally  taking  leave  of  this 
subject,  I  must  do  the  Americans  the  justice  to  say 
that  they  have  neglected  no  opportunity  of  testifying 
their  gratitude  and  appreciation  of  Mr.  Sidney 
Smith's  generous  and  kind-hearted  actions  regarding 
their  unhappy  countrymen.  His  first  visit  to  the 
States,  after  the  events  to  which  I  have  alluded,  was 
a  perfect  ovation  from  the  beginning  to  the  end  of 
his  journey.  In  conclusion,  it  must  seem  even  to 
the  most  sanguine  on  the  subject  of  the  annexation 
of  Cuba  by  America,  that  whatever  may  be  reserved 
for  the  future  to  bring  to  pass,  it  is  a  futile  and 
utterly  hopeless  dream  to  indulge  in  at  present. 
Without  going  into  the  political  question  between 
America  and  Spain,  or  the  foreign  influence  in 
Europe  which  would  be  brought  to  bear  on  the 
subject  upon  either  side,  it  seems  clearly  demonstrated that  Cuba  herself  wishes  no  change,  and  is 
intrinsically  loyal  to  the  Spanish  government.  Were 
this  not  the  case,  were  the  people  disposed  to  foster 
the  growth  of  disaffection  or  rebellion,  civil  war 
would  ere  now  be  rife  throughout  the  island,  and 
when  quelled  in  one  spot  would  speedily  break  out 
in  another.  As  I  have  had  occasion  to  remark  in 
the  course  of  this  little  narrative,  nature  has  provided every  convenience,  every  facility,  for  resisting 
the  powers  that  be.  A  very  small  number  of  rebels 
could  hold  out  against  an  army,  if  they  possessed 
the  good-will  of  the  peasants ;  but  that  up  to  the 
present  time  has  ever  failed  invaders,  —  filibusteros 
pirates,  et  hoc  genus  omne.  This  is  a  voluminous 
letter,  but  I  shall  send  it  by  a  private  hand.

32,"Havana,  Nov.  20th. — My  dear  Father, — Our  time 
has  passed  very  agreeably  since  our  return  from 
Mexico,  chiefly  in  mixing  with  the  private  society,  as 
there  has  been  a  good  deal  of  party-giving  during  the 
last  week  or  two.  The  hosts  and  hostesses  here  are 
every  thing  that  can  be  wished  for,  and  in  this  commendation I  include  those  of  all  nations.  Indeed  it 
would  be  difficult  to  specify  whether  Spanish,  English, 
French,  G-erman,  or  American  have  received  us  with 
the  most  cordiality  and  kindness.  Mrs.  Crawford,  the 
wife  of  the  English  Consul,  gives  weekly  receptions,  or 
tertullias  ou  Von  s'amuse,  I  must  confess,  far  more 
than  in  our  native  ""  at  homes  ""  or  the  dansants.  I 
cannot  help  thinking  that  one  cause  of  this  is,  that  in 
England  we  all,  not  only  the  ""  budding  misses,""  but 
all  of  us,  more  or  less,  are  constantly  thinking  ""  what 
he,  she,  it,  or  they  may  be  about.""  We  are  always 
wishing,  hoping,  or  expecting  something,  and,  until 
that  something  comes  or  happens,  we  make  it  a  sort  of 
point  of  honour  to  exemplify  in  another  sense  the 
Irishman's  exclamation,  ""  I  will  not  be  pleased,  and 
no  one  shall  please  me,""  instead  of  taking  things  as  they 
come,  or  as  they  are,  and  making  the  most  of  them, 
We  have  spent  also  many  pleasant  days  and  evenings 
with  two  of  the  married  sisters  of  Mrs.  Crawford,  who 
are  married  to  Germans,  and  who  reside  outside  the 
town,  that  is,  in  the  Serro.  The  charm  of  these 
quintas  is  indescribable;  the  freshness  of  the  air,  and 
the  fragrance  of  the  shrubs  and  flowers,  are  perfectly 
delicious;  and  if,  as  sometimes  occurred,  we  went  at 
night,  it  reminded  one  of  a  fairy  tale.  We  were 
literally  lit  ""  by  the  firefly's  lamp,""  myriads  of  these 
beautiful  little  earthly  stars  attending  us  on  our  way. 
One  English  and  two  French  men-of-war  are  here 
now,  whose  officers  help  to  enliven  our  tertullias.  We 
went  last  night  to  the  Tacon  with  the  Captain  General, a  grand  gala  night  in  honour  of  Queen  Isabel's 
fete-day.  The  house  was  brilliantly  illuminated 
a  giorno,  and  above  our  box  were  suspended,  for 
this  occasion  only,  full  length  portraits  of  the  Eoyal 
lady  and  her  husband.  Saw  Matilda  Diaz,  a  star  of 
Old  Spain,  who  has  come  to  astonish  the  Havanese. 
But  she  had  been  ill,  and  her  voice  was  still  weak, 
so  no  doubt  we  heard  her  to  disadvantage.  The 
national  air  of  Spain  was  played  and  sung  as  soon  as 
the  Captain-General  entered  the  house.  I  like  it 
very  much.  It  is  in  march  time,  'consequently 
quicker  than  ours,  but  very  inspiring.  I  should  mention  that,  before  the  opera  yesterday,  we  were  takeu 
by  the  good  nature  of  the  Captain-General  for  a  drive 
""  in  state,""  which  was  very  amusing,  as  well  as  agreeable. Every  body  and  every  animal  was  dressed  in  full 
costume,  something  like  our  birthday  drawing-room 
day  in  England.  The  carriage  we  were  in  was  an  open 
barouche,  the  arms  of  Spain  emblazoned  on  the 
panels.  The  interior  seats  and  cushions  were  of  rich 
amber  colour  satin,  and  the  horse's  harness,  caparisons, 
trappings,  &c.  all  gold. 

We  took  an  early  ride  on  horseback  this  morning 
to  the  village  of  Marianao  a  few  miles  out  of  town, 
and  famous  for  the  beauty  of  its  scenery  ;  the  multitude  and  grandeur  of  the 

""  palms  which  never  die,  but  stand 

Immortal  sea  marks  on  the  strand, 
Their  feathery  tufts  like  plumage  rare, 
Their  stems  so  high,  so  strange,  and  fair;  "" 

and,  lastly,  for  a  most  picturesque  and  beautifully  constructed bridge  over  the  little  river,  Almendares,  which 
is  in  fact  the  main  object  ""to  be  admired,""  say  the 
guide  books,  by  the  various  people  who  make  this 
excursion  from  Havana.  It  (the  bridge)  appeared 
to  me  to  be  very  much  on  the  principle  of  providing 
a  cathedral  arch  for  a  goose  to  walk  under,  the  river, 
or  rather  stream,  appearing  so  completely  out  of  all 
proportion  to  the  magnificence  of  the  bridge  thrown 
across  it.  Rivers  and  streams,  however,  in  these  parts 
of  the  world,  are  not  always  so  quiet  as  they  look,  and 
no  doubt  there  are  sufficient  reasons  to  justify  the 
strength  given  to  this  very  handsome  structure. 
Marianao  itself  is  a  favourite  resort  for  the  townspeople, when  they  want  a  little  repose  or  change  of 
air,  which  here  is  very  pure  and  healthy ;  and  the 
town  being  built  on  the  top  of  a  hill,  the  climate  is 
considered  more  bracing  than  Havana;  besides 
being  more  a  la  portee  of  most  people  than  the  expensive semi-palaces  of  the  ""  Serro,""  where  the  rich 
merchants  and  noblesse  chiefly  go  for  their  villeggiatura.  On  returning  to  Havana  this  morning,  we 
arrived  at  the  city  gates  in  company  with  all  the 
donkeys,  mules,  horses,  and  carts,  with  their  respective 
burdens,  going  to  market :  a  busy  as  well  as  amusing scene.  The  sellers  of  vegetables  and  fruits  especially, with  their  extraordinary  yet  musical  cries; 
the  panniers  laden  with  the  weight  of  pine- 
apples, melons,  guavas  bananas,  oranges,  lemons, 
sapotes,  cocoa-nuts,  prickly  pears,  and  several  other 
fruits  of  which  I  cannot  tell  the  names,  heaped  together in  luxuriant  profusion :  then  the  sellers  of 
fish  with  a  still  more  motley  and  incomprehensible 
collection  ;  the  dealers  in  ((  aves.""  i.  e.,  not  ""  Ave- 
Marias !  ""  but  birds  of  all  kinds,  alive  and  dead. 
This  united  collection  of  curiosities,  both  animal  and 
vegetable,  formed  altogether  a  scene  I  should  think 
unique  of  its  kind.  Seeing  the  various  provisions, 
too,  in  this  manner,  was  more  agreeable  than  paying 
a  visit  to  the  market-place  itself ;  as,  in  consequence 
of  the  very  dense  assemblage  of  blacks  in  attendance 
for  the  purpose  of  purveying  for  their  own  or  their 
master's  household,  the  odours  are  not  exactly  those 
of  Araby  the  Blest. 

24:th.  —  The  day  after  the  rejoicings  in  honour  of 
the  queen  I  have  related  in  the  earlier  part  of  this 
letter,  a  very  tragical  event  has  occurred.  Madame 
Domingue,  the  prima  donna  of  the  opera,  a  good 
singer  and  a  very  pretty  woman,  was  murdered  by 
her  husband,  on  her  return  from  the  opera,  where  she 
had  been  performing  one  of  her  favourite  parts.  She 
was  stabbed  in  forty  different  places.  The  wretched 
man  endeavoured  to  kill  himself  immediately  afterwards but  was  unsuccessful ;  he  has  therefore  been 
brought  to  trial,  and  to-day  was  pronounced  guilty. 
Jealousy,  as  may  be  supposed,  was  the  cause  of  the 
crime.  His  hallucination  on  this  point  appears  to 
have  been  carried  to  such  an  extent,  that  I  doubt 
whether,  had  he  been  tried  for  the  murder  in  England 
instead  of  here,  he  would  not  have  been  acquitted  on 
the  ground  of  insanity.  He  seems  to  have  been 
possessed  with  the  idea  that  his  wife  was  unfaithful 
to  him,  and  that  the  object  of  her  fancy  was  the 
Captain-General !  Moreover  he  persuaded  himself 
that  she  was  in  the  habit  of  getting  up  from  her  bed
in  the  middle  of  the  night  for  the  purpose  of  visiting 
her  supposed  lover  at  the  Quinta !  As  all  this  was 
manifestly  a  delusion,  she  having  been  actually  present before  his  eyes  on  some  of  the  occasions  he 
maintained  she  was  absent,  besides  it  being  proved 
that  the  Captain-General  had  never  seen  Madame 
Domingue  at  all,  except  on  the  stage,  it  would  seem 
certain  that  the  unfortunate  man  was  not  a  responsible being.  Still,  I  am  very  much  inclined  to  think 
it  more  merciful  to  society  in  general  to  put  an  end 
to  so  dangerous  a  lunatic  as  this.  Mad  or  not,  when 
one  person  deliberately  cuts  another  to  pieces,  he  may 
well  meet  the  fate  of  an  assassin.  The  authorities  here 
are  apparently  of  the  same  opinion,  as  this  malefactor 
is  condemned  to  the  garotte,  and  will  be  executed  in 
a  few  days.  .  .  .  We  are  going  to-morrow  a  few 
miles  into  the  country  for  the  purpose  of  visiting  a 
tobacco  plantation.  I  shall  write  an  account  of  it  in 
my  next.  For  the  present,  then,  adieu. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 
C. "
33,"Havana,  November  26th.- —  My  dear  Father,  —  We 
have  now  returned  from  the  proposed  visit  to  a  ""Vega"" 
or  tobacco  plantation,  to  which  I  alluded  in  my  last 
letter,  and  we  have  greatly  enjoyed  our  excursion.  I 
was  anxious  to  see,  and  if  possible  to  thoroughly  understand, all  about  this  very  important  branch  belonging 
to  the  ""  Cosas  de  Cuba.""  This  ground  of  which  I 
am  now  writing  is  on  an  estate  belonging  to  Queen 
Christina  of  Spain,  who  possesses  a  good  bit  of  property of  one  kind  or  another  in  this  island.  A  very 
important  accessory  to  all  lots  or  portions  of  land  devoted to  the  culture  of  the  tobacco-plant  is  a  river, 
or  running  stream,  in  the  close  vicinity.  Whether  this 
be  an  indispensable  adjunct  or  not  I  could  not  clearly 
discover,  but  the  intendente  who  explained  everything to  me  said  the  cigarros  were  always  much  finer 
flavoured  when  grown  near  water;  and  certainly,  as  far 
as  I  can  recollect,  in  all  the  tobacco  grounds  I  have  seen 
there  was  always  a  rivulet  at  least  of  some  kind  or  another  close  by.  The  proper  name,  by  the  way,  of  what  we 
call  tobacco;  is  ""  Cohiba,""  but  in  the  olden  time,  when 
the  Spaniards  first  came  across  the  Atlantic,  among 
other  good  will  offerings  made  them  by  the  Indians 
were   u  tobaccos ""   of  the   cohiba  plant ;  that    is  to 
say,  the  rolled  leaf  or  leaves  (cigars  in  short)  prepared 
for  smoking  was  named  by  them  a  ""  tobacco  ;""  hence 
the  mistake  arose,  the  Spanish  supposing  the  name  of 
the  manufacture  was  the  name  of  the  plant.      This 
error  has,  however,  never  yet  been  corrected,  and  is  not 
likely  to  be  so,   now  that  long  use  and  habit  have 
sanctioned  the  wrong  appellation.     To  proceed  therefore, tobacco  (not  cohiba)  is  seldom  grown  in  larger 
lots  or  portions  of  ground  than  would  cover  about 
twenty  acres  in  one  place.     I  mean  by  this,  that  one 
proprietor  may  possess  three  or  four,  or  more  tobacco 
gardens  or  plantations,  but  they  are  studded  about 
different  parts  of  his  territory,  and  no  one  of  them 
is  of  greater  extent  than  from  twenty  to  thirty  acres. 
The  principal  reason  of  these  small  subdivisions  is, 
that,  being  a  tolerably  manageable  article  of  culture, 
small  capitalists  may  venture  on  it ;  consequently,  in 
many  and  most  instances,  the  grounds -are  underlet, 
and   rented   of  the    original  proprietor.       Another 
and  very  important  circumstance  in  favour  of  cultivating tobacco  in  preference  to  other  natural  productions here,  especially  for  the  majority  of  European 
residents,  is  that  it  can  be  tended  by  white  people. 
From  six  to  eighteen  or  twenty  labourers,  according 
to  the  size  of  the  lot,  are  sufficient  for  all  that  is  required in  the  management.  Before  the  year  1820, 
tobacco  was  a  government  monopoly,  but  since  then 
this  restriction  has  been  removed  with  respect  to  Cuba, 
a  tax  only  being  levied  on  each  arroba  or  weight  of 
25  Ibs.  In  Old  Spain,  I  believe,  the  monopoly  still 
exists  on  all  grown  in  the  country  actually.  But  it 
was  found  not  to  answer  in  the  colonies.  My 
cicerone,  who  was  good-natured  enough  not  only  to 
explain  in  an  ordinary  way,  but  to  tell  me  all  the 
various  processes  and  stages  from  the  very  beginning, 
said  there  was  little  manual  labour  or  difficulty  in 
its  cultivation,  but  that  it  required  the  most  constant 
watching  and  care,  and,  furthermore,  no  little  exercise 
of  judgment  as  to  the  proper  times  and  seasons  in 
which  to  cut,  to  prune,  to  clip,  to  water,  and  to  thin 
in  quantity,  so  very  much  of  the  after  goodness  and 
delicacy  of  flavour,  whether  in  cigars  or  in  snuff, 
depending  on  their  treatment  in  this  their  infant 
cabbage  state ;  and  this  knowledge  cannot  be  gained 
by  the  laying  down  of  regular  rules,  or  any  distinct 
course  of  treatment,  but  must  be  the  result  of  careful 
observation  and  repeated  experiences.  When  the 
season  of  gathering  arrives,  the  leaves  are  stripped 
from  the  stem,  spread  out  as  flat  as  may  be,  and 
placed  in  packets  of  twos  and  threes  to  dry.  These 
leaves  have  been  divided  into  four  different  classes, 
each  varying  in  its  degree  of  excellence.  Speaking 
of  the  tobacco  plant  as  of  a  cabbage, —  to  which  it 
bears  more  resemblance  than  any  other  I  can  think 
of,—  the  leaves  nearest  the  heart  are  the  most  valuable, and  are  called  ""desechos.""  Those  immediately 
contiguous  to  them  come  next;  they  are  named 
""  desechitos.""  The  two  remaining  qualities,  numbers three  and  four,  are  respectively  called  ""libras"" 
and  ""  injuriados.""  They  are  formed  of  the  lower 
and  coarser  leaves  of  the  plant;  the  ""libras""  being 
the  better  and  tenderer,  and  the  ""  injuriados  ""  being 
the  lower  and  external  leaves  nearest  to  the  root  and 
the  ground.  This  last  class,  namely,  the  injuriados, 
are  in  their  turn  sub-divided  into  three ;  called 
""  injuriado  de  repaso ""  (which  means  chosen  or 
selected),  ""injuriados  primeras""  and  "" segundas."" 
There  is,  in  addition  to  those  I  have  mentioned, 
another  hybrid  sort,  composed  of  the  slightly  injured leaves  of  classes  two  and  three,  namely,  the 
desechitos  and  libras,  which  go  by  the  rather  contradictory name  of  ""  injuriados  buenos.""  And  indeed 
I  may  add  another  and  worst  class,  made  of  worm- 
eaten  or  otherwise  spoilt  leaves.  This  is  uncompromisingly and  frankly  called  here  ""injuriado  malo; 
but  I  am  by  no  means  sure  that  it  is  not  sold  in 
other  countries  under  a  far  better  sounding  name. 
Having  given  these  details  so  far,  I  will  now  return 
to  the  packets  on  the  drying-ground  before  mentioned. 
When  sufficiently  dried,  they  are  collected  together 
and  assorted  in  bundles,  rather  resembling  sheaves 
of  corn ;  each  sheaf  containing  about  fifty  leaves  of 
number  four,  or  injuriados,  and  twenty-five  leaves 
of  number  three,  or  libras.  These  sheaves  are  in 
their  turn  formed  into  larger  loads,  at  the  rate  of 
four  to  a  faggot,  and  are  then  called  ""  manojos.""  A 
hundred  and  forty  manojos  constitute  a  ""tercio;"" 
and  it  is  in  this  form  they  are  sent  away  from  their 
native  earth,  either  to  be  rolled  into  cigars  or  used 
a  la  Yankee,  &c.  Two  tercios  constitute  a  weight, 
called  a  carga,  equal  to  eight  arrobas,  or  200  Ibs. 
This  measure  is  the  one  which  is  charged  for  —  so 
much  a  carga  —  in  questions  of  freight.  Connected 
with  these  manojos,  I  observed  a  curious  purpose  to 
which  the  bark  of  the  palm  tree  is  put.  The  outer 
peel  of  the  stem,  which  is  of  a  kind  of  scaly  substance, being  removed,  it  is  used  as  an  envelope  or 
covering  for  each  tercio,  or  bundle  of  140  manojos, 
preserving  the  tobacco  hermetically  from  air,  damp, 
or  other  injury.  These  envelopes  are  called  in  Cuban 
dialect,  ""yaguas.""  From  the  above  particulars, 
which  I  hope  I  have  given  with  sufficient  clearness 
to  be  useful  to  those  who  may  be  interested  in  the 
subject,  it  will  be  seen  that  the  first  or  ultra-superior 
sort  of  cigars  must  necessarily  be  small  in  quantity 
compared  to  those  made  from  the  more  numerous 
and  larger  leaves.  Still  it  may  be  satisfactory  to 
know,  if  you  cannot  get  the  best,  what  the  next 
qualities  should  be,  and  also  what  are  good  mixtures. 
The  proportionate  produce  of  the  various  qualities, 
according  to  the  returns  of  the  year  1853,  was,  to 
a  ""caballeria""  or  piece  of  ground  of  thirty-two  acres, 
9,000  Ibs.  of  tobacco.  Of  this  quantit3T,  450  Ibs.  only 
(or  one-twentieth)  are  contributed  by  the  desechos, 
or  first  class;  1800  by  the  desechitos;  2250  by  the 
libras;  and  4500  by  the  injuriados.  In  speaking 
of  the  various  sorts,  it  may  be  remembered  that  I 
have  mentioned  some  of  the  leaves  as  worm-eaten. 
On  this  part  of  the  history  of  tobacco  culture  my 
guide  was  most  eloquent.  It  would  appear  that  a 
taste  for  (( the  fragrant  weed  ""  is  by  no  means  confined to  the  human  race  :  every  description  of  worm, 
snail,  and  creeping  thing  seems  to  be  addicted  to  the 
habit.  Month  after  month  do  their  depredations 
continue,  and  one  marauder  only  gives  way  to  be 
succeeded  by  another  worse  than  himself.  It  is  the 
injury  and  often  destruction  caused  by  these  insects 
that  renders  it  imperative  on  the  tobacco-grower  to 
keep  such  a  continual  watch  over  his  plants,  to  examine them  narrowly,  and  every  day,  and  to  be  on 
the  look-out  to  discover  and  arrest,  before  it  be  too 
late,  the  inroads  of  the  enemy.  By  far  the  most 
formidable  of  these  insect  adversaries,  however,  is 
the  ant ;  and  of  this  tribe  a  particular  species,  called 
""  vivijaguas,""  are  blessed  with  so  voracious  an  appetite, that  woe  be  to  the  unlucky  plantation  into 
which  they  succeed  in  making  good  their  entry. 
It  is  but  rarely  they  can  be  expelled  before  they 
have  devoured  everything.  I  was  told  —  but  the 
relation  seems  to  me  so  apocryphal,  that  in  repeating it  I  merely  ""  tell  the  tale  as  told  to  me,"" 
not  as  believing  it,  namely — that  the  plague  of  ants, 
having  at  one  time  reached  such  a  degree  of  intensity, that  the  whole  tobacco  trade  was  threatened with  annihilation,  when  some  inventive  genius 
bethought  him  of  importing  a  foreign  army  for  the 
purpose  of  exterminating  the  natives !  France  was 
applied  to  (I  should  have  thought  America  more  to 
the  purpose),  who  benevolently  furnished  a  ""  legion  "" 
of  ants,  which  speedily  commenced  operations,  and 
by  keeping  the  unfortunate  aborigines  in  constant 
hot  water  by  means  of  skirmishes,  sieges,  and  battles, 
saved  the  tobacco  crops!  In  addition  to  these 
terrestrial  helps,  the  powers  above  come  in  also  for 
their  share  of  praise  and  gratitude.  A  celestial 
worthy  called  Saint  Marcial,  and  whose  prowess  and 
exploits  against  ants  seem  to  have  beaten  Saint 
George  and  the  dragon  quite  to  smithereens,  has 
masses  and  all  manner  of  similar  delicate  attentions 
paid  to  him  by  the  tobacco-growing  portion  of  the 
inhabitants  of  the  beautiful  ""  Queen  of  the  Antilles.'' 
His  day  is  the  30th  of  June,  on  which  occasion  all 
tobacco-growers  here  go  to  church,  even  if  the  ants 
keep  them  away  on  other  occasions.  In  conclusion 
of  (e  the  great  tobacco  question,""  it  may  be  mentioned 
that  the  quantity  now  exported  annually  from  Cuba 
averages  11,250,000  Ibs.  of  branch  or  leaf  tobacco,  and 
1,250,000  Ibs.  twisted  rolls  or  cigars  (I  speak  now  of 
legal  exportation);  and  the  quantity  consumed  in  the 
island  averages  about  7,500,000,  but  an  immense 
deal  it  is  well  known  is  smuggled  in  spite  of  the 
vigilance  of  the  authorities.  The  parts  of  Cuba  most 
favourable  to  the  growth  and  good  condition  of  the 
plant  are  the  western  and  southern  districts  generally. In  the  east  the  produce  is  of  an  inferior  kind. 
The  sort  called  ""  Virginian  ""  is  chiefly  grown  here. 
The  proprietor  or  renter  of  a  vega  does  not  depend, 
however,  only  on  tobacco  for  his  livelihood  or  profit. 
By  a  bountiful  provision  of  nature,  the  same  soil  is 
peculiarly  propitious  to  the  constitution  of  the  plantain tree,  which  may  almost  be  termed  the  bread  and 
meat  of  the  labourer  in  the  tropics;  they  roast,  fry, 
boil,  and  dress  the  fruit  in  every  imaginable  way,  and 
can  by  the  addition  sometimes  of  a  little  rice,  or 
chilis,  or  oil,  or  frijoles  (a  sort  of  red  bean  greatly 
liked),  vary  their  food  or  its  mode  of  preparation  every 
day.  In  all  vegas  therefore  the  plantain  tree  holds 
a  distinguished  situation ;  besides,  though  that  is  of 
no  consequence  to  the  agriculturist,  the  general  character of  the  ground  is  infinitely  improved  in  a 
picturesque  point  of  view  by  the  intermixture  of 
these  graceful  trees  with  the  cabbagy-looking  tobacco 
bushes.  It  is  calculated  that  the  number  of  plantains, that  is  to  say,  the  fruit  produced  by  the 
plantain  tree,  exceeds  that  of  all  the  other  vegetable 
productions  of  the  same  class*  added  together.  The 
government,  who  institute  the  most  minute  statistical 
inquiries  concerning  everything,  have  obtained  on 
this  head,  for  instance,  the  curious  computation  that 
ten  millions  four  hundred  thousand  arrobas,  which 
multiplied  by  twenty-five  make  two  hundred  and 
sixty  millions  Ibs.  weight  of  plantains,  are  annually 
grown  in  Cuba. 

*  Namely,  the  Yuca  or  Cassava  root,  the  Baniato,  the  Name,  and 
Malanga,  the  three  last  being  species  of  potatoes  and  yams. "
34,"THE  Captain- General  has  sent  me  a  beautiful  present in  the  shape  of  a  genuine  Havana  fan.     The 
carvings  in  mother-of-pearl  and  tortoiseshell,  executed 
by  the  Havanese  artisans,  are  extraordinary  specimens 
of  fine  and  curious  workmanship,  fan-making  being 
the   principal  and  most   lucrative   branch   of  their 
handiwork.     I  do  not  know,  and  do  not  remember 
whether  any  ancient  chroniclers  inform  us,  if  fans 
were  used  in  Spain  before  the  discovery  of  America, 
though,  j  udging  by  the  manners  and  customs  of  the 
people  here,  I  should  be  rather  inclined  to  think  this 
must   have   been   their   native   place.     During   the 
whole  time  of  my  sojourn  in  Cuba,  I  never  remember a  single  instance  of  noticing  a  native  woman 
or  girl  without  a  fan  in  her  hands.     Of  course  they 
vary  much  in  quality,  but  of  some  kind  or  other,  a 
fan  is  an  indispensable  adjunct  to  the  get-up  of  the 
female  sex.     That  which  I  have  just  received  is  most 
elaborately  and  delicately  carved  in  mother-of-pearl. 
The  intricacies  of  a  design  embracing  fruit,  flowers, 
and  birds,  are  worked  with  the  most  wonderful 
minuteness ;  indeed,  so  much  so  as  to  more  resemble 
those  curious  and  skilfully  cut-out  papers  one  sees 
placed  over  French  plums  or  bonbons.  The  tips  of 
these  finely  worked,  expensive  fans  are,  like  this  one, 
painted  either  on  parchment  or  vellum,  and  are  imported from  Paris,  painting  being  one  of  the  fine 
arts  in  which  the  Cubans  have  yet  to  distinguish 
themselves.  Tortoiseshell,  as  I  have  also  mentioned, 
is  brought  to  as  great  a  state  of  perfection  in  the 
carving  as  mother-of-pearl.  While  on  the  subject 
of  hand  labour  I  must  not  omit  to  notice  another 
manufacture  for  which  one  part  of  the  island,  the 
coast  near  and  about  Trinidad,  is  famous,  namely,  the 
making  sticks,  canes,  and  various  similar  kinds  of 
objects,  of  the  bones  of  a  colossal  fish,  called  the 
""  manati,""  or  sea-cow.  The  manati  chiefly  resorts  to 
the  mouths  of  rivers,  and  shows  a  preference  for 
what  is  neither  quite  salt  nor  quite  fresh  water.  In 
appearance  it  greatly  resembles  a  whale,  but  with 
rather  a  pig-shaped  head.  I  can  only  judge,  how- 
ever, from  pictures,  as  I  never  was  lucky  enough  to 
see  one  either  alive  or  dead.  The  back-bone  is  the 
part  most  generally  used  for  the  articles  they  manufacture from  the  animal,  as  the  purest  and  clearest 
pieces  are  here  obtained.  The  cane  is  of  most 
remarkable  strength,  and  has  the  colour  and  apparent consistency  of  amber,  but  is  far  harder  and 
stronger.  So  great  indeed  is  considered  to  be  the 
danger  which  might  accrue  from  either  a  thoughtless 
or  angry  use  of  it,  that  its  employment  as  a  walking- 
stick  or  weapon  is  absolutely  prohibited  in  the  island, 
a  very  slight  stroke  having  been  attended  some  time 
since  with  fatal  results.  Nevertheless,  it  seems  to  me 
to  be  a  most  arbitrary  and  moreover  useless  measure 
to  forbid  their  use,  as  a  death-blow  might  be  dealt 
with  any  sort  of  stick  if  maliciously  and  violently 
struck.  I  should  for  my  part,  however,  even  were 
there  no  prohibition,  think  their  weight  in  the  hand 
the  most  forcible  argument,  especially  in  a  hot  climate, against  carrying  them  about.  Even  when, 
only  of  the  thickness  of  most  ordinary  sticks,  they  are 
most  unpleasantly  heavy. 

November  30th. — Went  to  the  opera  to-night  for 
the  double  purpose  of  thanking  the  Captain-General 
for  the  fan,  and  also  to  try  my  hand  at  flirting  it  in 
the  proper  Havanese  manner.  I  think  I  have  succeeded pretty  well,  and  shall  no  doubt  improve  with 
practice.  The  only  difficulty  is  to  flirt  it  slowly 
enough,  so  as  to  give  the  long,  drawling  kind  of  rattle 
which  is  so  marked  a  peculiarity  to  be  observed  in 
the  Tacon  assemblages.  A  drawling  rattle  seems  a 
contradictory  form  of  expression,  yet  I  can  think  of 
no  better  term  to  describe  my  meaning.  All  the 
fans,  with  very  few  exceptions,  being  made,  as  I  have 
before  said,  of  mother-of-pearl  or  tortoiseshell,  the 
sort  of  clicking  sound  of  the  opening  and  closing  one 
fan  in  the  orthodox  slow  and  measured  way,  when 
multiplied  four  or  five  hundred  times  and  continued 
incessantly,  gives  very  much  this  impression  to  the 
ear.     Yet,  strange  to  say,  the  effect  is  by  no  means 
disagreeable.     Though  a  noise  certainly,  it  is  a  gentle 
one,    and   actually   harmonises  very  well   with   the 
music.     Apropos  of  national  customs,  it  is  a  singular 
fact  that  the  graceful  and  beautiful  Spanish  man- 
tilla does  not  find  favour  with  the  fair  inhabitants 
of  Cuba.     It    is    the   more   incomprehensible   that 
whereas  in  Mexico,  where  the  Spaniards  no  longer 
rule,  the  fashion  of  wearing   mantillas  among  the 
higher,  and  rebosos  (a  coarser  sort  of  the  same  thing) 
among  the  lower  classes,  still  universally  prevails ; 
here,  on  the  contrary,  though  essentially  Spanish  in 
other  tastes  and  opinions,  a  mantilla  is  never  seen. 
Women,  old  and  young,  drive  about  in  their  volantes 
with  decolletees  dresses  of  all  colours,  the  senoras 
blazing  with  jewels  on  both  neck  and  head,  and  the 
senoritas  with  wreaths  or  bunches  of  flowers.     Also  I 
must  not  forget  a  most  important  item  in  Havana 
toilettes,  namely,  the  cascarilla  powder  which  they 
all,   but   more   especially  the   young,  most  plentifully lay  on  their  faces,  necks,  arms,  and  hands.     It 
is  used  in  the  most  incredible  quantities,  but  without 
the  slightest  attempt  at  disguise :  indeed,  they  say, 
and  no  doubt  with  truth,  that  it  saves  them  from
being  burnt  by  sun  or  wind.  But  the  effect,  espe- 
cially at  night,  is  singular  in  the  extreme.  One  does 
not  always  see  the  powder  then  (indeed,  one  can  very 
seldom  distinguish  it  by  candle-light),  and  as  they 
never  use  rouge,  the  contrast  between  their  magnificent black  hair,  large  dark  eyes,  and  the  snowy 
appearance  given  to  the  skin  by  this  powder,  affords 
a  most  striking  coup  d'ceil  —  particularly  remarkable when  they  are  dancing  at  a  ball  or  tertullia — no 
heat,  no  exercise,  ever  causing  any  apparent  alteration 
in  the  complexion,  or  sending  any  visible  flush  to 
the  cheek.  In  speaking  of  the  Havanese  manner  of 
spending  the  evening,  their  music  or  their  dancing, 
as  the  case  may  be,  I  should  not  omit  mentioning  a 
nightly  custom,  not  the  least  singular  or  romantic  of 
the  catalogue, — I  mean  the  musical  cries  of  the  watchmen calling  the  hours  of  the  night.  To  me  it  is  quite 
an  inducement  to  try  and  remain  awake  for  two  or 
three  hours  for  the  purpose  of  listening  to  them.  They 
generally  begin  by  some  kind  of  invocation  to  the 
Virgin,  coupled  with  the  name  occasionally  of  the 
saint  whose  day  it  may  happen  to  be.  For  example, 
""  Ave  Maria  sanctissima  !  Madre  de  Dios !  y  Santa 
Teresa  Virgen  !  Estan  las  dos  de  la  manana  y  sereno."" 
As  it  is  very  seldom  that  the  weather  is  anything 
else  than  ""sereno,""  there  is  little  variation  in  the 
latter  part  of  this  oration ;  but  the  tone,  the  melody, 
is  really  beautiful.  The  whole  is  sung  like  an  opera 
""  recitative,""  and  the  last  word  ""  sereno  ""  is  cadenced 
with  a  ""  sweetness  long  drawn  out,""  reminding  one 
of  Mario's  ""  Addio ! ""  I  must  now  conclude  this 
longish  letter.  I  fear  the  tobacco  part  of  it  will  not 
interest  you  greatly,  not  being  a  smoker.  Still,  as 
tobacco  is  so  very  important  a  matter  in  Cuba,  I 
have  given  you  a  little  sketch  on  the  subject. 

Your  always  affectionate, 

C."
35,"Dec.  2nd.  —  The  time  is  now  rapidly 
approaching,  my  dear  Father,  when  we  must  take 
a  long  farewell,  I  fear,  of  Havana,  as  I  have  promised 
to  spend  Christmas-day  at  Barbados.  Yesterday  our 
old  friend,  Captain  Parker,  commanding  the  ""  Dee,"" 
arrived  here  on  his  way  to  Vera  Cruz.  He  was  detained at  New  York  a  considerable  time,  the  work- 
people there  having  had  a  great  press  of  business 
on  hand.  However,  the  old  ship  looks  considerably 
the  better  for  the  painting  and  decoration  she  has 
received.  We  have  decided  on  going  to  St.  Thomas 
in  her  when  she  returns  from  the  Vera  Cruz  trip. 
This  Captain  Parker  expects  to  be  in  about  a  fortnight. 
Meantime  we  shall  endeavour  to  visit  some  other 
parts  of  this  island,  although  it  will  be  difficult  to 
tear  ourselves  away  from  the  pleasant  daily  routine 
of  our  lives  at  Havana. 

Dec.  5th.  —  The  Fates  have  been  unpropitious  ;  for 
after  having  all  in  readiness  to  set  out  on  our  little 
tour  Tuesday  last,  the  illness  of  the  friend  who  was 
to  accompany  us  has  delayed  us  till  now,  and  now 
our  time  is  short.  To  save  as  much  as  possible  we 
went  last  night  by  steamboat  to  Matanzas,  which  we 
reached  this  morning  (the  6th)  after  a  rougher  and 
more  unpleasant  passage  than  we  have  yet  experienced 
since  we  first  ventured  on  the  Atlantic.  Every  one 
was  ill,  myself  included,  wonderful  to  relate — very  discreditable, I  must  confess,  for  a  twelve  hours' voyage ! 
We  brought  with  us  a  letter  of  introduction  to  Mr. 
Brinckenhoff,  a  gentleman  residing  here  (a  partner 
in  the  banking-house  of  Drake  &  Co.).  This  gentleman has  most  kindly  placed  everything  at  our  ""  dis- 
position,"" and  among  other  things  has  provided  us 
with  saddle-horses.  So  when  it  had  become  rather 
cooler  we  set  out,  and  had  a  most  delightful  ride  in 
view  of  one  of  the  most  beautiful  and  thoroughly 
tropical  scenes  we  have  yet  witnessed  in  our  wanderings. Cumbre  and  the  valley  of  ""  Yumuri ""  were  the 
two  points  of  destination  in  our  excursion.  The 
word  ""  Yumuri ""  has  a  romantic  and  mournful  derivation. In  ancient  days,  soon  after  the  discovery  of  the 
western  world,  the  original  inhabitants  of  this  valley were  cruelly  persecuted  by  the  Spaniards  in  their 
fanatic  zeal  for  the  spread  of  Christianity.  After  being 
hunted  like  wild  beasts  from  place  to  place,  bloodhounds were  finally  employed  to  track  them.  In  the 
desperation  they  were  driven  to,  sooner  than  be  massacred in  cold  blood,  many  of  them  threw  themselves 
from  the  heights  into  the  river  flowing  below,  with  the 
wailing  cry  of  ""  To  moir  !  ""  ""  I  die  :  ""  hence  the  name 
Yumuri.  It  was  very  lovely,  and  reminded  me  of  the 
far-famed  description  of  the  Vale  of  Cashmere.  We 
looked  down  from  a  great  height  over  groves  of 
palm-trees  (the  trees  of  fairy-land),  orange  trees 
bending  beneath  their  burden  of  golden  fruit,  sugar 
plantations  spreading  far  and  wide,  over  hill  and 
dale,  all  tinged  with  a  colour  the  tropics  alone  can 
show ;  then  the  winding  river,  and  the  bright  sparkling blue  sea  in  the  distance  bounding  all,  formed  a 
picture  not  easily  to  be  forgotten. 

7th.  —  Set  out  very  early  this  morning  by  the 
""  Coliseo  ""  railroad,  and  in  about  an  hour  stopped  at 
Cardenas,  near  which  place  is  the  residence  of  a  planter 
to  whose  house  we  were  addressed  by  Mr.  Brinckenhoff. 
They  are  Americans,  and  gave  us  a  kindly  and  hospitable welcome  and  an  excellent  breakfast,  after  which 
we  mounted  our  horses,  and  this  time  took  a  longer 
ride  than  before.  After  a  course  of  ten  miles,  we 
reached  a  sugar  estate  belonging  to  Mr.  Drake,  and 
christened  by  the  American  name  of  Saratoga.  He 
(Mr.  Drake)  is  now  in  Paris,  but  has  left  his  slaves 
and  estate  in  the  care  of  a  superintendent  who 
received  us.  We  went  to  the  sugar-house,  and  saw 
the  whole  process  of  making  the  sugar.  Everything 
now  is  rendered  comparatively  easy  to  the  slaves 
here,  owing  to  the  use  of  machinery.  Perhaps  the 
most  interesting  part  of  the  whole  is  the  first 
process  which  the  sugar-canes  undergo  when  cut 
from  the  plantation  or  field.  They  are  sent  pell- 
mell  into  a  machine  looking  like  a  tilted  waggon, 
by  which  they  are  impelled  down  an  inclined  plane, 
and  when  they  reach  the  bottom  they  are  caught 
in  the  embrace  of  two  huge  rollers  turned  by  a 
steam  engine,  and  by  them  are  crushed  and  ground 
into  shapeless  pulps.  The  pure  syrup  thus  produced 
is  the  ""  first  state  ""  of  the  sugar.  The  slaves,  malgre 
Mrs.  Beecher  Stowe,  look  exceedingly  happy,  and 
tminteresting.  Mr.  Drake  has  about  600  on  this 
estate.  After  having  nearly  boiled  ourselves  in  the 
sugar-house,  we  mounted  our  horses  and  rode  all 
round  the  estate  and  through  the  plantations.  I 
never  enjoyed  a  ride  so  much,  nor  experienced  such 
complete  novelty.  Far  as  the  eye  could  reach, 
the  sugar-canes  spread  themselves  around  us,  looking 
at  a  distance  like  a  vast  jungle,  —  monotonous,  yet 
possessing  a  beauty  peculiarly  their  own,  with  the 
tender  green  of  their  tapering  leaves,  and  undeniable grace  of  their  feathery  flowers  crowning  the 
canes  as  with  delicate  blue  plumes.  Then  the  exhilarating effect  on  the  spirits  of  cantering  over  the 
soft  turf  through  the  long  glades  cut  in  every  direction though  the  canes.  I  should  never  have  tired 
for  my  own  part,  I  believe,  but  my  steed  demanded 
some  consideration ;  so,  most  reluctantly,  I  wended 
my  way  at  length  back  to  the  house.  We  paid 
another  visit  at  night  to  the  sugar-buildings.  Saw 
the  slaves  at  supper,  and  tasted  some  capital  bread 
and  treacle  they  offered  us. 

8th.  —  Keturned  to  Matanzas  very  much  gratified 
by  all  we  had  seen.  -Mr.  Brinckenhoff  having 
kindly  pressed  us  to  stay  another  day  with  him  and 
his  daughter,  we  have,  nothing  loth,  accepted  his 
good-natured  invitation.  After  breakfast  we  took  a 
walk  about  the  town,  and  along  the  sea-shore  for 
some  distance ;  a  pretty,  bright  scene,  and  most 
agreeable  temperature.  In  the  afternoon  we  visited 
Mr.  B.'s  tobacco  ground. 

9th. — After  having  passed  a  most  agreeable  time 
with  our  kind  hosts  at  Matanzas,  we  this  morning 
returned  by  the  Grumes  railroad  though  Eegla  to 
Havana.  Here  we  found  our  old  friend  the  Captain- 
General  making  his  preparations  for  departure,  his 
three  years  of  government  having  nearly  expired. 
He  and  his  suite  are  to  start  on  their  return  to 
Spain  the  week  after  we  leave.  Sorry  as  I  am  to 
bid  farewell  to  Havana  on  many  accounts,  it  is  some 
small  consolation  that  one  of  the  best  and  most 
valued  of  our  friends  here  is  going  away  too.  He 
has  made  me  a  present  of  two  dear  little  gazelles, 
which  I  shall  hope  to  be  able  to  keep  alive  in 
England;  also  three  very  handsome  specimens  of 
Labrador  ducks,  with  which  I  propose  ornamenting 
the  Chauntry  ponds.  General  Canedo  had  a  small 
menagerie  at  his  quinta,  being  particularly  fond  of 
animals.  These  gazelles  were  his  especial  pets :  it  is 
therefore  doubly  kind  of  him  to  give  them  to  me. 
Captain  Parker  has  most  good-naturedly  offered  to 
take  charge  of  them,  see  they  are  well  lodged  and 
fed  on  board  ship,  and  bring  them  safe  to  England.* 
As  we  shall  be  very  busy  from  now  until  the  time  of 
our  departure,  I  shall  close  this  letter.  If  I  have  time 
I  will  write  once  again  before  leaving. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 

C. 

*  My  hopes  on  this  subject  were  never  realised.  Spite  of  every 
care,  the  poor  gazelles  died  within  a  week  of  leaving  the  tropics.  A 
bitter  east  wind  in  the  English  Channel  finished  them. "
36,"Havana,  December  26th.  —  My  dear  Father, — The 
""Dee""  arrived  to-day,  and  if  all  be  well  we  shall  hope  to 
embark  in  her  to-morrow ;  but  the  last  of  our  sojourn 
here  has  been  saddened  by  a  most  unexpected  and 
melancholy  occurrence.  Two  days  after  my  last 
letter,  a  young  man  of  about  two-and-twenty,  the 
nephew  of  a  gentleman  (a  judge  by  profession,  I 
understand)  who  had  only  arrived  from  New  Orleans 
a  few  days  previously,  complained  in  the  middle  of 
dinner  that  he  felt  ill.  He  was  recommended  to  go 
to  bed  and  take  some  simple  remedy,  it  being 
supposed  he  had  got  a  chill  which  a  night's  rest 
would  cure.  Nothing  more  was  then  thought  of  the 
incident,  and  if  any  anxiety  were  expressed  it  was 
rather  for  the  uncle,  who  was  an  old  man,  I  believe, 
but  I  never  saw  him,  and  who  had  never  come  out  of 
his  room  since  his  arrival  at  the  hotel.  The  next 
day  the  young  man  was  pronounced  better,  and  was 
to  get  up  and  join  us  at  table  at  supper.  He  did  not 
come,  however,  but  about  twelve  o'clock  at  night,  I, 
whose  bedroom  was  next  to  his,  was  aroused  by  hearing moans  and  the  sound  of  some  one  tossing  about 
violently  in  bed.  I  immediately  woke  up  the  mistress of  the  hotel  and  the  servants,  and  the  doctor 
being  summoned  instantly,  the  disease  was  declared 
to  be  yellow  fever  in  its  worst  form.  But  this,  terrible as  it  was,  was  not  so  bad  as  what  followed.  The 
surprise  and  the  sudden  shock,  I  suppose,  of  the  much 
dreaded  ""vomito  ""  being  so  near  in  all  its  horrors, 
caused  such  a  panic  among  the  inmates  of  the  house 
that  the  morning  had  scarcely  dawned  before  they  all 
took  their  departure,  and  I  am  sorry  to  add  that  of 
many  American  women  who  were  under  this  roof  not 
one  remained  to  help  their  countryman  in  his  hour 
of  need.  The  whole  affair  seems  to  me  like  a 
frightful  dream.  Towards  the  end  of  the  day,  partly 
from  curiosity  and  partly  from  solicitude,  and  moreover not  having  the  slightest  fear  of  infection  myself, 
I  went  into  the  sufferer's  room,  and  there  witnessed 
that  which  decided  me  to  remain  and  tend  him  till 
all  should  be  over,  whether  for  good  or  for  evil.  A 
nurse  had  been  engaged  —  sent  from  the  hospital  - 
a  thorough  hireling ;  and  as  I  entered  she  was  endeavouring violently  to  force  a  spoon  with  some  ice 
in  it  between  the  poor  patient's  teeth,  which,  in  the 
strong  convulsive  fits  which  at  periods  attacked  him, 
nearly  locked  the  teeth  together.  Poor  fellow!  he 
was  quite  sensible  then,  though  he  could  not  speak. 
I  saw,  by  the  wistful  look  of  his  eyes,  how  he  appreciated gentle  handling  and  speaking  to.  Some  hours 
after,  in  an  interval  of  calm,  he  told  me  he  recognised 
me,  and  called  me  by  my  name.  Another  night  and 
another  day  dragged  on,  when  towards  five  o'clock 
it  became  evident  the  end  was  approaching.  I  think 
nearly  at  the  last  he  was  conscious,  as  he  signed  to 
me  to  take  his  hand  and  warm  it  between  mine,  as 
I  had  done  before.  He  then  turned  his  head  away ; 
and  about  half  an  hour  after  that,  the  doctor  pronounced all  was  over — the  pulse  had  ceased  to  beat. 
Now  that  the  reaction  has  come,  and  I  have  time 
to  think,  I  begin  both  to  feel  frightened  and  to 
wonder  if  I  shall  escape,  not  only  on  my  own  account, 

but  on  E 's,  who  was  too  courageous  to  run  away 

like  the  rest.  Still,  though  I  did  not  go  near  her 
during  this  painful  week,  she  was  under  the  same 
roof.  The  Captain-General  has  just  been  spending 
one  last  hour  with  us  to  say  good-bye,  and  in  hopes 
we  .may  all  meet  again  in  the  old  country.  We  are 
to  embark  at  sunset,  dull  and  dispirited  enough  ;  but 
we  must  hope  for  the  best,  though  danger  is  not 
considered  over  for  nine  days. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 

C."
37,"St.  Thomas,  Dec.  21  st.  —  My  dear  Father, — You 
will  be  glad  to  find  by  the  date  of  this  that  we  have 
arrived  here  in  safety,  and  I  am  happy  to  add  that 
the  sea-breeze  and  change  of  scene  have  had  a  very 
beneficial  effect ;  I  am  fast  recovering  from  my  depression, and  hope  I  am  no  longer  in  danger  of 
catching  the  fever.  St.  Thomas  looks  green  and 
pretty  as  before,  though  now  it  has  lost  the  charm  of 
novelty.  The  weather  being  fine  and  calm,  Captain 
Parker  sent  us  in  the  boat  on  an  excursion  to  San 
Martin,  another  of  the  little  cluster  of  islands  belonging to  the  Danish  crown.  San  Martin  is  chiefly 
frequented  as  a  kind  of  watering-place  for  the 
benefit  of  the  residents  in  St.  Thomas  when  they 
wish  to  ""  go  out  of  town.""  The  Governor  is  now 
here  with  his  family.  Our  principal  reason  for 
making  this  marine  promenade  was  to  avoid  being 
present  at  the  disagreeable  operation  of  coaling, 
which  renders  the  vessel  almost  unbearable  while  it 
lasts,  the  black  dust  penetrating  into  every  nook  and 
corner,  however  well  guarded ;  besides  which  the 
coal  wharf  is  said  to  be  the  most  unhealthy  spot 
possible — the  hot-bed  of  yellow  fever,  cholera,  and 
all  manner  of  diseases.  They  have  a  strange  custom 
here  which  I  should  not  forget  to  mention,  namely, 
that  the  actual  bodily  labour  of  carrying  the  loads 
of  coals  from  their  original  depot  at  the  wharf  to  the 
ship's  side  is  performed  by  women,  whose  privilege 
it  especially  is,  and  who  would  energetically  resist 
any  encroachment  by  the  other  sex.  We  have  just 
returned  from  our  expedition.  The  old  ""  Dee  ""  is  in 
tolerable  order,  but  the  world  in  general  is  in  a  great 
state  of  dismay  and  tribulation.  You  would  never 
guess  what  has  happened,  so  I  must  tell  you.  A 
ship,  laden  with  ice,  from  the  United  States  has 
struck  upon  one  of  the  Virgin  Grordoa  rocks.  The 
crew  are  all  safe  and  sound,  but  the  ice  has  gone  to 
the  bottom  of  the  sea.  It  sounds  rather  ridiculous 
to  hear  the  lamentations  raised  in  consequence  of 
this  catastrophe ;  still,  no  doubt  we  as  well  as  others 
shall  feel  the  discomfort  of  getting  warm  wine  and 
water,  melted  butter*,  &c.  An  odd  complaint — is  it 
not  ? — to  make  at  Christmas  time  ! 

Martinique,  Dec.  24th. — Since  leaving  St.  Thomas 
three  days  ago  we  have  been  winding  through  the 
mazes,  and  touching  for  a  few  hours  at  many  of  these 
beautiful  Windward  Islands,  or  lesser  Antilles.  St. 
Christopher's  or  St.  Kitt's,  Nevis,  Montserrat,  Antigua,  Dominica,  and  Guadaloupe  were  successively 
visited.  The  islands  of  St.  Kitt's  and  Nevis  are 
within  sight  of  each  other.  The  former,  of  which 
the  principal  town  is  called  Basse  Terre,  is  of 
a  hilly,  rugged  character,  but  wondrously  green. 
One  of  the  eminences  I  particularly  observed  as  resembling smooth  green  velvet,  is  called  ""  Monkey 
Hill.""  These  animals  are  to  be  found  in  abundance 
here.  A  mountain  peak  about  2000  feet  above  the 
sea  bears  the  unpleasant  name  of  Mount  Misery. 
Moreover  the  fort  and  head-quarters  of  whatever 
regiment  may  happen  to  be  stationed  here  is  placed 
on  one  ""  Brimstone  Hill.""  Disagreeable  associations, 
I  think,  accompany  both  these  names ;  yet,  as  far  as 
I  could  judge  in  my  short  visit,  there  seemed  nothing to  justify  any  complaints  either  of  the  climate 
or  fertility  of  the  soil.  Nevis  is  most  remarkably 
beautiful.  The  island  appears  to  be  composed  of 
one  large  mountain,  rising  from  the  sea  to  the  sky 
until  its  crest  is  lost  in  the  clouds.  It  is  supposed 
that  the  present  name  of  Nevis  is  a  corruption  from 
""  Nieves,""  the  Spanish  for  ""  snow/'  and  that  Columbus, who  was  its  discoverer,  called  it  ""  Nieves "" 
from  the  white  clouds  hovering  round  its  summit 
and  giving  it  the  appearance  of  being  snow-capped. 
The  vegetation  is  peculiarly  luxuriant,  the  mountain 
side  clothed  with  sugar-cane,  while  graceful  groups 
of  palmetto,  fern,  and  cocoa-nut  trees  detach  themselves  in  dark  relief  against  the  paler  hue  of  the 
canes.  The  steamer  anchored  in  the  small  bay  of 
Charlestown,  a  little  place  scarcely  more  than  a 
village  in  size,  but  which  enjoys  the  honour  of  being 
called  the  capital  of  Nevis.  Montserrat,  with  the 
singular-looking  rock  near  it  called  Kedonda,  was 
next  touched  at,  but  here  we  did  not  land.  A  few 
hours  after  brought  us  to  Antigua,  where  we  anchored 
in  what  is  called  English  Harbour.  The  general 
character  of  the  scenery  to  be  distinguished  from 
this  point  is  not  at  all  un-English,  no  palms  or 
other  essentially  tropical  plants  being  visible,  and 
the  shore  being  rather  flat.  There  are  two  small 
forts  opposite  to  each  other  commanding  the  entrance 
to  the  harbour.  These  forts  are  respectively  named 
Fort  Charlotte  and  Fort  Berkeley.  I  was  in  hopes  of 
meeting  with  the  Bishop  of  Antigua  and  Mrs.  Davis, 
who  came  out  with  us  in  the  (e  Parana""  from  England, 
and  who  wished  us  to  pay  them  a  visit  in  the  course 
of  our  peregrinations.  But  I  heard  that  at  present 
they  are  staying  at  St.  John's,  the  cathedral  town 
of  Antigua,  which  is  about  twelve  miles  off,  and 
consequently  too  far  to  enable  us  to  go  there  and 
return  before  the  ""  Conway  ""  resumes  her  voyage.  I 
hope,  however,  on  pur  way  back  to  be  able  to  devote 
a  day  to  them.  We  left  Santa  Maria  de  la  Antigua, 
to  call  it  by  its  real  full-length  designation,  at  dusk, 
and  the  next  morning  at  seven  o'clock  found  ourselves  in  the  roadstead  of  the  French  island  of 
Gruadaloupe.  Being  very  anxious  to  see  both  the 
colonies  belonging  to  France  in  the  Caribbean  seas, 
or  as  much  of  them  as  was  practicable,  I  took  the 
opportunity  of  the  first  boat  bound  for  the  shore 
to  place  myself  in  her,  and  landed  at  Basse  Terre. 
It  is  curious  to  observe  how,  in  spite  of  difficulties 
or  obstacles,  natural  or  otherwise,  the  French  always 
manage  to  give  a  sort  of  Parisian  air  to  whatever 
town  or  place  they  may  occupy.  The  first  object 
which  met  my  gaze  on  landing  was  something  very 
much  resembling  a  boulevard, — a  long  street  going 
up  a  steepish  hill  to  be  sure,  but  with  formal  rows 
of  trees  at  each  side  of  the  way.  That  the  trees 
happened  to  be  palms  and  mangoes  was  a  little 
variety  certainly,  but  there  they  were;  there  also 
were  the  gaily  decorated  shops,  the  cafes,  the  little 
marble  tables  and  wooden-backed  chairs.  Basse 
Terre,  moreover,  seems  in  all  respects  a  cheerful, 
flourishing,  and  very  picturesque  town.  The  houses 
are  mostly  painted  in  gay  colours.  This  practice, 
when  employed  in  a  sunny  climate  and  under  a 
bright  sky  like  this,  greatly  enhances  the  beauty  of 
the  outward  appearance  of  ordinary  habitations. 
The  Place  d'Armes,  where  a  parade  was  taking  place, 
struck  me  as  very  like  that  of  Havana,  only  on  a 
smaller  scale.  I  lingered  for  some  time  watching 
the  scene,  enjoying  the  early  morning  air,  and  listening  to  the  merry  strains  of  the  regimental  band. 
We  now  proceeded  to  ascend  the  heights  behind  the 
town,  not  a  very  easy  task,  as  those  boulevard  streets 
whereof  I  have  before  made  mention  are  not  only 
carried  up  the  steepest  of  hills,  but  are  paved  with 
those  particularly  disagreeable  sharp-pointed  stones 
or  pebbles  which  make  one  shrink  at  every  step. 
But  in  due  time  we  were  amply  repaid  by  the  magnificent prospect  afforded  us.  The  Souffriere,  a 
volcanic  mountain  of  nearly  5000  feet,  frowns  over 
the  island  and  gives  grandeur  to  the  landscape, 
while  the  numerous  forests  and  groves  of  trees  and 
shrubs  of  every  variety  of  hue,  gently  undulating 
down  to  the  calm  blue  sea,  shed  a  charm  over  every 
object;  and  even  our  old  tub,  i.e.  the  ""  Con  way,"" 
looked  well,  or  at  least  dignified,  sleeping  on  the 
quiet  waters.  The  Souffriere  keeps  up  a  pretty 
constant  habit  of  smoking,  and  a  few  sparks  are 
occasionally  to  be  seen ;  but  no  mention  is  made  by 
the  inhabitants  of  Gruadaloupe  of  anything  like  an 
eruption.  On  descending  to  the  town  again  we  were 
conducted  into  the  house  of  one  of  the  French 
officials,  I  do  not  know  who ;  but  we  were  regaled  with 
a  most  excellent  dejeuner  a  la  fourchette,  partly 
French,  partly  West  Indian  cuisine ;  but  most  ex- 
cellent and  acceptable  it  was,  hungry,  thirsty,  hot 
and  tired  as  we  were.  (Should  I  be  fortunate  enough 
to  number  our  hospitable  Amphitryon  amongst  my 
readers,  I  hope  he  will  observe,  that  although  a 
considerable  time  has  elapsed,  I  have  neither  for- 
gotten the  incident  nor  his  courtesy.)  We  now 
re-embarked,  bade  adieu  to  Gruadaloupe,  and  towards 
the  middle  of  the  day  made  Dominica.  The  ap- 
proach to  this  island  showed  finer  scenery,  I  think, 
than  any  of  those  at  which  we  have  yet  touched  ; 
stupendous  precipices  rise  straight  from  the  water's 
edge,  but  in  the  interstices  and  clefts  of  the  ravines 
formed  by  them  grows  the  most  luxuriant  vegetation. 
I  do  not  ever  remember  having  seen  such  beautiful 
ferns  as  are  found  here.  Their  variety  seems  end- 
less. The  town  where  the  steamer  calls  to  receive 
and  take  the  mails  is  called  Eoseau.  I  believe  there 
is  a  small  stream  in  the  neighbourhood  which  gives 
its  name  to  the  town,  which,  by  the  way,  is  rather 
difficult  of  access.  There  is  no  harbour,  and  you 
must  land  in  boats  across  a  surf  which  in  any  but 
the  calmest  weather  is  both  disagreeable  and  dan- 
gerous. Roseau,  and  indeed,  I  believe,  Dominica 
itself,  are  not  either  of  them  in  a  sufficiently  flou- 
rishing condition  to  allow  of  the  expenditure  which 
would  be  necessary  for  the  formation  of  a  harbour, 
or  the  building  of  many  other  edifices  which  are 
now  wanting.  There  is  absolutely  nothing  worthy 
of  remark  in  Roseau,  the  view  and  general  aspect 
of  the  surrounding  country  being  the  only  induce- 
ment to  land.  On  the  apparently  flat  summit  of  a 
steep  eminence  called  Morne  Bruce,  the  little  gar- 
rison thought  necessary  for  the  preservation  of 
Dominica  in  the  way  it  should  go,  or  stop,  is 
quartered.  It  must  be  a  dreary  life  for  the  soldiers 
in  spite  of  the  beauty  of  the  scenery.  About  eighteen 
miles  from  here  is  Prince  Rupert's  Bay,  also,  I 
believe,  a  very  beautiful  part  of  the  island,  but 
which  we  had  not  time  to  visit.  Here  tradition 
says  that  the  gallant  Prince  Rupert  died,  and  his  tomb 
is  shown  on  the  sea-shore.*  Coffee  seems  to  be  the 
most  successful  production  of  Dominica  as  far  as 
I  can  judge.  We  observed  several  healthy-looking 
plantations,  and  were  informed  that  the  commerce 
with  the  neighbouring  islands,  particularly  the 
French,  in  this  commodity,  forms  a  favourable  con- 
trast to  other  matters  in  general.  Leaving  Roseau, 
a  very  short  run  now  sufficed  to  bring  us  to  Mar- 
tinique, and  we  have  just  cast  anchor  in  the  Bay  of 
St.  Pierre. 

I  fear  we  have  been  unwittingly  the  cause  of 
much  disappointment  to  the  good  people  here.  As 
we  were  preparing  to  get  into  the  boat  for  the 
purpose  of  going  on  shore,  we  were  attracted  by  the 
signs  of  an  unusual  stir  on  land,  canopies  being 
erected,  crimson  carpets  spread  over  the  ground, 
triumphal  arches  of  shrubs  and  flowers  raising 
themselves  on  high  from  places  where  they  had 
evidently  lain  in  readiness ;  and  lastly,  multitudes  of 
people  hastening  to  the  water's  edge  all  on  the 
tiptoe  of  expectation  of  something  or  somebody. 
As  we  neared  the  shore  and  could  distinguish  the 
countenances,  we  observed  looks  of  blank  disap- 
pointment and  surprise.  The  mystery  was  soon 
solved.  A  new  archbishop  has  lately  been  appointed 
to  the  see  of  Martinique,  and  he  was  expected  and 
ought  to  have  come  by  this  month's  vessel,  and  all 
manner  of  honours  and  fetes,  as  I  have  said,  were 
awaiting  him.  But  the  ludicrous  part  of  the  affair 
was,  that,  whether  from  the  distance  of  the  ship  or  that 
the  expectant  multitude  had  no  telescope,  it  appears 
that  at  first  they  mistook  me  and  my  friend  for  the 
bishop  and  chaplain,  and  only  discovered  their  error 
when  our  proximity  showed  we  were  women !  I 
imagine  this  absurd  quiproquo  must  have  arisen 
from  the  circumstance  of  our  being  both  enveloped 
in  black  silk  mantillas  instead  of  bonnets,  and  these 
at  a  distance  might  have  been  mistaken  for  priests' 
garments.  It  was  too  late,  however,  to  undo  in  a 
moment  all  that  had  been  prepared ;  so  over  the 
carpets  and  under  the  arches  we  walked,  and  thus 
made  our  triumphal  entree  into  St.  Pierre.  I 
must  do  the  St.  Pierreians,  however,  the  justice  to 
say  that  notwithstanding  their  annoyance  and  their 
having  so  much  trouble  for  nothing,  they  showed 
nothing  but  good-nature  and  the  national  good 
breeding  towards  us,  helping  us  and  giving  us  all 
necessary  information  to  enable  us  to  see  as  much 
of  Martinique  as  we  could  during  our  short  stay. 
The  town  of  St.  Pierre  bears  a  great  resemblance 
to  its  sister  city  in  G-uadaloupe,  the  same  cheerful- 
looking  cottages,  the  quays  bordered  with  trees,  and 
the  streets  have  a  similar  boulevard  look.  Mar- 
tinique has,  I  think,  the  advantage  in  general  beauty 
of  scenery.  It  is,  in  truth,  ""  with  verdure  clad  ""  of 
the  loveliest  hue.  There  appear  to  be  more  palm- 
trees  here  too  than  I  have  seen  anywhere  since 
leaving  Cuba,  and  here  they  seem  to  grow  up  to 
the  extreme  top  of  the  mountains,  and,  as  may  be 
supposed,  much  enhance  the  grandiose  and  majestic 
appearance  of  the  land.  This  island  has  ever  pos- 
sessed great  attraction  in  my  eyes,  from  being  the 
birth-place  of  Josephine,  the  cradle  of  her  che- 
quered life.*  After  our  departure  from  St.  Pierre, 
and  just  as  the  day  was  declining,  we  came  in  sight 
of  the  ""  Diamond  Bock,""  a  sugarloaf-shaped  hill  at 
the  extreme  south  of  the  island,  and  the  scene  in 
olden  times  of  many  hard  struggles  between  us  and 
France.  There  is  a  tale  told  of  a  naval  hero  (Captain 
Morris)  having  swung  up  a  cannon  to  the  top  of  the 
rock,  and  so  caused  wonderful  deeds  to  be  done  to  the 
detriment  of  the  French ;  but  it  is  a  tale  so  oft  told 
about  no  end  of  places  in  this  part  of  the  world, 
besides  forming  an  incident  in  one  of  Captain 
Marryatt's  ""  veracious  ""  novels,  that  I  am  inclined 
to  treat  the  whole  affair  as  a  fiction.  So,  with  this 
apocryphal  anecdote,  I  shall  conclude  my  letter  now, 
it  4  being  nearly  twelve  o'clock,  and  I  am  going  on 
deck  to  see  the  moon  shining  on  St.  Lucia. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 
C. "
38,"Barbados,  Christmas  night. — My  dear  Father, — 
I  have  now  reached  the  goal,  and  attained  what,  since 
leaving  England,  was  the  only  object  of  my  long 
voyage,  the  place  of  abode  of  the  friend  I  crossed  the 
Atlantic  to  visit.  How  far  I  have  wandered  during 
these  five  months,  and  how  little  I  imagined,  on 
setting  out,  the  distance  to  which  my  tour  would 
extend  !  My  last  letter  was  closed  at  the  moment 
we  were  nearing  St.  Lucia,  the  beautiful,  but  deadly. 
We  anchored  for  a  few  hours  in  the  harbour  of 
Castries,  the  principal  town.  It  is  difficult  to  believe 
that  danger  or  death  can  lurk  in  anything  so  lovely. 
I  never  beheld  a  scene  more  magically  beautiful 
than  this,  the  moon  at  the  time  shedding  her  soft 
light  over  land  and  sea.  Yet  the  history  is  too  universal and  too  often  repeated  to  be  false,  which  tells 
us  that  fever,  miasma,  and  death  are  the  habitual 
guests  in  this  plague-stricken  isle,  which  nevertheless 
looks  like  what  we  may  suppose  the  garden  of  Eden 
to  have  been.  Alas  for  romance !  the  only  real 
resemblance  between,  Paradise  and  St.  Lucia  is  the 
""  trail  of  the  serpent  over  all.""  Speaking  seriously, 
the  plague  of  serpents,  scorpions,  and  every  description of  poisonous  reptile,  is  so  deadly,  that  even  I, 
who  am  not  easily  turned  aside  from  visiting  or  exploring strange  or  new  places,  have  relinquished  all 
idea  of  landing  at  St.  Lucia,  though  it  will  be  daylight on  the  occasion  of  our  next  visit.  A  little 
before  sunset  to-day,  the  coast  of  Barbados  was 
clearly  discernible,  soon  after  we  entered  Carlisle  Bay, 
in  which  lies  Bridgetown,  the  place  of  our  destination. What  an  extraordinary  and  almost  incredible 
difference  there  is  between  the  external  appearance 
of  this  and  the  island  I  have  been  describing  to  you 
in  the  beginning  of  my  letter !  The  approach  to 
Barbados,  it  must  be  owned,  is  as  nearly  approximating to  ugly  as  anything  in  nature  can.  Flat, 
white,  sandy,  chalky !  This  does  not  sound  picturesque, and  it  is  still  less  so.  In  short,  I  was  very 
forcibly  reminded  of  the  Sussex  shore  near  Brighton, 
but  without  the  town  of  Brighton  to  make  amends 
for  the  dreary  rest  of  the  scene.  We  anchored 
about  eight  o'clock,  and  were,  to  my  great  joy,  almost 
immediately  boarded  by  my  friend's  husband  and 
several  other  old  acquaintances  in  the  36th,  whom  I 
had  not  met  since  we  spent  the  winter  in  the  Ionian 
Islands. 

January   5th. — We  have  now  been   a  week   at 
Barbados,  chiefly  occupied  in  joining  the  festivities 
incidental  to  the  Christmas  and  New  Year  time.  I 
had  always  heard  a  great  deal  of  Barbadian  hospitality, and  I  may  very  sincerely  say  that  it  has  more 
than  equalled  my  anticipations.  As  I  cannot  give 
you  a  detailed  account  of  when  and  where  each  fete 
took  place,  I  must  just  note  down  dinners,  rides, 
balls,  picnics,  &c.,  as  they  come  to  my  recollection. 
But  first  of  all  I  will  give  you  a  sketch  of  our  abode. 
A  charming  little  yellow  cottage,  bungalow-shaped, 
and  raised  from  the  ground  by  a  few  steps,  but  once 
inside,  no  going  up  or  down  stairs ;  all  the  rooms  are 
en  suite. 

Whilst  sitting  in  the  drawing-room,  by  the  bye, 
windows  and  doofs  being  always  open,  we  are  constantly charmed  by  the  visits  of  the  most  exquisite 
little  humming-birds,  who  dart  through  the  room — 
in  at  one  window  and  out  at  another,  like  a  flash  of 
lightning.  The  cottage  is  enclosed  in  a  small  but 
very  pretty  garden  or  rather  shrubbery,  where  grow 
many  a  flower  and  tree  unknown  to  us  except  in 
hothouses  ;  one  particularly,  of  which  I  have  yet  to 
learn  the  name,  serves  the  Creole  ladies  as  a  ball- 
dress  decoration.  The  leaves,  instead  of  being  green, 
are  a  rich  scarlet,  and  being  of  a  very  velvety  texture 
one  can  sew  them  on  to  a  white  dress,  and  thus  make 
an  inexpensive,  and,  to  a  brunette,  a  becoming 
toilette.  Mrs.  P.  has  come  in  Jaden  with  a  complete 
garniture  for  Eleanor  and  herself,  to  be  used  at 
Greneral  Wood's  ball  to-night.  We  rode  on  horseback, a  few  mornings  back,  to  a  village  called 
Speightstown,  about  three  miles  distant,  and  returned to  be  present  at  the  parade  of  the  regiment,  a 
ceremony  which,  as  in  the  Mediterranean,  afforded  an 
opportunity  for  the  gathering  together  of  all  the  beau 
monde  and  otherwise.  Speightstown  seemed  to  me 
to  be  only  inhabited  by  negroes.  I  have  seldom  been 
more  amused  than  by  this  ride,  the  exceeding  drollery of  appearance  they  all  present,  their  talk,  their' 
impudence,  the  songs  they  improvise  about  yourself 
while  passing  them.  The  way  they  set  about  doing 
everything  is  so  perfectly  ludicrous,  I  could  not  help 
fancying  them  a  lot  of  baboons  got  up  as  a  travestie 
on  men  and  women.  Eeceived  yesterday  a  letter 
and  cards  from  the  Governor  of  Barbados,  Sir  W. 
Colebrooke,  and  his  daughters,  apologising  for  not  calling in  person,  owing  to  illness  of  the  former.  With 
this  exception,  I  think  we  have  already  made  the 
acquaintance  of  the  island.  At  a  dinner  party  given 
a  few  days  ago,  I  tasted  the  renowned  Barbadian 
dish  called  ""  Pepper-pot,""  and  think  it  well  deserves 
all  the  laudation  it  receives.  I  was  rather  surprised 
at  finding  it  was  served  hot, — I  do  not  know  why,  but 
I  had  always  fancied  it  was  a  cold  galantine  sort  of 
edible.  However,  it  is  very  good.  It  is  made  of 
fish,  flesh,  and  fowl,  I  believe — a  kind  of  gipsy  pot 
au  feu  —  things  being  added  day  by  day.  "" 
a  condiment  resembling  Harvey's  sauce  and  anchovy, 
is  a  principal  ingredient  in  flavouring  the  whole. 
While  on  the  subject  of  eating  and  cooking,  I  must 
not  forget  to  mention  one  of  the  greatest  delicacies 
in  the  West  Indian  cuisine,  namely,  ""  land  crabs."" 
There  is  a  regular  season  for  them.  They  come  in 
swarms  at  one  part  of  the  year,  and  cross  over  the 
land.  They  go  over  everything  in  their  way,  not 
turning  aside  for  houses,  but  go  up  the  walls  and 
across  the  roof.  Of  course  plenty  are  stopped  on  the 
road  and  prematurely  cut  off  from  further  prosecuting their  travels.  They  are,  when  stuffed  and  well 
seasoned,  remarkably  good  eating. 

4th.  —  We  had  a  brilliant  ball  last  night.  The 
general  commanding  the  forces  out  here,  General 
Wood,  with  his  wife  and  daughters,  were  the  hosts. 
There  was  a  good  sprinkling  of  the  navy,  which 
made  a  pretty  variation  with  the  red  coats,  also 
several  of  the  Barbadian  families  settled  here  ;  the 
rooms  were  beautifully  decorated  with  cactus,  ferns 
and  other  tropical  plants,  which,  together  with 
coloured  lights  peeping  from  the  shrubberies 
outside,  heightened  the  beauty  of  the  scene  exceedingly. 

10th.  —  Just  returned  from  a  picnic  excursion  at 
""  Scotland,  ""  a  part  of  Barbados  about  fourteen  miles 
from  hence,  which  bears  this  rather  grandiloquent
denomination.  I  believe  the  name  was  conferred 
originally  on  this  place  from  its  being  of  a  slightly 
mountainous  or  rather  hilly  character,  besides  being 
the  only  bit  of  ""  scenery  ""  of  which  poor  Barbados 
can  boast.  It  is,  however,  remarkably  picturesque, 
a  bluff  headland  of  steep  rock  jutting  out  into  the 
sea.  A  path,  or  rather  I  should  say  steps,  are  hewn 
in  this  rock,  in  the  crevices  of  which  grow  aloes, 
oleander,  cactus,  and  lastly  heather  I  So  ""  Scotland  "" 
is  not  such  a  misnomer  after  all.  To  descend  these 
steps  to  the  sea  shore,  and  thence  enjoy  both  the 
view  and  the  fresh  breeze,  is  the  favourite  passe-temps 
whilst  the  chickens  and  champagne  are  getting  ready 
on  the  heathery  sward  above.  The  spot  chosen  for  our 
repast  was  under  the  shade  of  some  fine  cabbage 
palms,  with  a  view  in  the  distance  of  Codrington 
College,  a  sort  of  priests'  seminary  for  Church  of 
England  men,  endowed  by  Colonel  Codrington.  Our 
picnic  was  scarcely  ended  before  unfortunately  there 
came  one  of  those  tropical  storms  of  rain  of  which 
Europeans  have  little  notion.  We  had  all  to  fly 
wherever  we  best  could  at  a  moment's  notice;  and  as 
it  was,  some  of  our  party  did  not  escape  a  severe 
wetting.  Those  who  came  off  best  had  taken  refuge 
among  the  sugar-canes  of  a  neighbouring  field,  which 
from  their  height  and  thickness  afforded  tolerable 
protection. 

I  think  by  this  time  you  will  be  of  opinion  that 
my  letter  is  long  enough,  so  I  will  close  and  despatch 
it  at  once,  resuming  my  adventures,  perhaps,  in  about 
a  week's  time. 

Ever  your  affectionate,   
C. "
39,"Barbados,  January  15th. — My  dear  Father, —  Our 
very  agreeable  stay  here  is  fast  drawing  to  an  end. 
The  island  steamer,  which  will  convey  us  away,  is 
expected  in  two  days  more,  so  we  are  making  the 
best  use  of  the  short  time  that  remains.  We  were 
present  a  few  nights  ago  at  a  coloured  ball  given  by 
the  soldiers  of  the  West  India  Regiment,  quartered 
here.  They  had  invited  both  their  own  officers  and 
those  of  the  36th,  with  their  wives  and  families.  It 
was  a  curious  spectacle  —  at  least  it  appeared  so  to  me, 
as  I  cannot  yet  familiarise  myself  to  the  sight  of  black 
ladies  (as  they  are  very  tenacious  of  being  called)  in 
delicate-coloured  ball-dresses.  I  was  so  amused  on 
the  morning  of  this  ball  night  at  being  called  in 
very  mysteriously  by  one  of  Mrs.  P.'s  women-servants, who  requested  I  would  accompany  her  into 
her  bed-room.  I  went — and  beheld  spread  out  on 
the  sofa  two  wonderful  dresses,  one  a  canary-coloured 
tarlatane  with  four  flounces  and  a  profusion  of  bows 
of  riband,  and  the  other  a  deep  rose-coloured  silk, 
ornamented  with  green  leaves.  Between  these  two 
""  Lydia ""  begged  I  would  give  my  opinion  which 
would  ""  become  ""  her  best,  and  she  promised  to  abide 
by  my  decision.  It  was  a  grave  dilemma ;  however, 
I  decided  in  favour  of  the  tarlatane,  thinking  black 
and  yellow  would  probably  look  better  than  black, 
pink,  and  green.  She  seemed  quite  satisfied  and 
danced  merrily  in  the  evening,  and  I  only  hope  she 
felt  convinced  that  she  was  the  belle  of  the  room. 
Next  day  we  took  a  drive  to  visit  some  friends  residing at  White  Park,  about  five  miles  from  Bridge 
Town.  Though  there  is,  with  the  exception  of  Barbadian Scotland,  very  little  striking  scenery  in  the 
island,  yet  the  near  view  of  the  country  is  pretty 
enough.  There  are  flowers  in  profusion  to  be  had 
for  the  trouble  of  gathering,  and  I  was  tempted  many 
times  on  our  way  to  White  Park  to  jump  out  of  the 
pony  chaise  to  load  myself  with  the  spoils  of  the 
hedgerow.  Jessamine  and  passion-flowers  are  the 
most  abundant.  On  our  return  we  drove  into  Bridge 
Town.  There  is  little,  however,  deserving  of  note  here. 
The  shops  are  poor-looking;  still  the  contents  are 
better  than  those  of  the  other  islands,  I  believe.  The 
principal  ""  place  ""  is  called  Trafalgar  Square,  and 
has  a  statue  of  Nelson,  The  Cathedral  is  a  tolerably 
good-looking  building,  and  the  Barracks  of  St.  Anne 
are  large,  well  built,  and  provided  with  every  comfort 
required  for  the  soldiers.  They  have  only  very  lately 
returned  to  these  barracks,  as  last  year,  in  consequence 
of  both  yellow  fever  and  cholera  breaking  out,  the 
soldiers  were  all  removed  into  tents  on  the  high 
parade-ground,  and  lived  there  encamped  for  many 
months,  until  all  was  restored  to  its  original  healthy 
condition  in  the  island. 

16th. — We  have  just  returned  from  the  last  visit 
to  be  paid  in  Barbados,  as  our  time  of  departure  is 
near  at  hand.  This  excursion  was  to  dine  and  spend 
the  day  with  the  family  of  a  planter,  Mr.  C, who 
entertained  us  at  their  country  house.  I  have  enjoyed 
myself  exceedingly.  The  amusements  were  varied ; 
besides  walking  about  the  beautiful  gardens,  there  was 
dancing,  swinging  in  hammocks,  and  floating  on  the 
lake  in  small  canoes.  The  dinner  was  given  on  purpose to  show  us  all  the  peculiarities  of  the  best  West 
Indian  cookery.  We  had  callipash  and  callipee, 
pepper-pot  and  land  crabs,  turtle  steaks  and  hot 
pickles,  yams  and  sweet  potatoes,  and  salad  made  of 
the  aguacate  pear.  Then  for  fruit,  guavas,  guava 
jelly,  pomegranates,  sapotes,  custard  apples,  forbidden 
fruit,  and  the  above-mentioned  aguacate  pears.  I 
have  taken  some  trouble  to  try  and  obtain  some  reliable information  as  to  how  aguacate  should  be  spelt, 
but  I  am  by  no  means  sure  even  now  that  I  have 
succeeded.  By  some  it  is  called  avocado,  by  others 
aquacada,  and  lastly  aguacate.  I  have  chosen  this, 
as,  in  the  few  instances  where  any  attempt  at  giving 
a  derivation  has  been  made,  it  was  observed  there 
was  something  about  water ;  therefore,  assuming  the 
derivation  to  be  Spanish,  ""  agua,""  being  the  translation of  ""  water,""  is,  I  think,  the  more  correct  term  of 
the  two.  The  English  people,  however,  cut  the  Grordian 
knot  by  calling  it  by  the  singular  appellation  of 
""  subaltern's  butter.""  For  this  there  is  a  reason,  and 
not  a  bad  one.  Butter  is  not  very  good  and  is  very 
dear  in  the  West  India  islands,  but  this  aguacate  pear 
makes  a  very  good  substitute,  and  at  a  very  small 
cost.  The  taste  is  very  like  ordinary  fresh  butter 
in  which  a  little  oil  has  been  mixed.  Eaten  with 
plenty  of  bread  it  is  very  good,  or  made  into  a  salad, 
as  we  had  it  to-day,  with  a  little  salt,  pepper,  mustard, and  vinegar ;  but  it  is  far  too  rich  to  eat  alone  as 
a  fruit. 

17th. — Took  leave  of  hospitable  Barbados  and  our 
numerous  friends.  A  parting  compliment  was  paid 
to  us  by  the  36th  Eegiment,  whose  officers  themselves 
manned  a  boat  and  rowed  us  to  the  steamer,  which 
was  waiting  in  Carlisle  Bay,  while  part  of  the  band 
followed  in  another  boat  playing  ""  Should  old  acquaintance be  forgot."" 

20th. — Though  now  we  have  not  on  this  our  return trip  left  the  steamer,  it  has  been  a  great  pleasure 
to  see  again  the  fairy  islands,  for  without  exaggeration they  may  well  be  called  so.  Their  beauty  does 
not  pall  on  the  eye  or  the  taste.  Seen  from  the  water 
I  am  not  sure  that  the  littJe  island  of  St.  Kitt's  should 
not  rank  next  to  St.  Lucia  in  picturesque  and  wild 
scenery ;  but  it  would  be  a  difficult  task,  putting  Barbados of  course  hors  de  combat,  for  any  one  to  decide 
which  particular  one  of  the  Antilles  should  be  termed 
the  most  beautiful.  It  being  daylight  on  this  occasion, I  was  sorely  tempted,  malgre  the  serpents,  to 
invade  St.  Lucia,  it  is  so  wondrously  beautiful ;  and 
the  day  more  than  fulfilled  the  promise  of  the  night. 
The  two  ""  Pitons,""  high  sharp- pointed  rocks,  rising 
from  the  centre  of  the  land  straight  into  the  clouds 
apparently,  are  most  imposing  objects.  They  are 
said  to  be  quite  inaccessible  to  human  feet,  and,  as 
usual  with  any  such  natural  phenomena,  frightful 
legends  exist  concerning  them.  The  most  generally 
accredited  story  is  that  they  are  guarded  by  Pythons, alias  boa  constrictors,  who  deal  summarily 
with  any  one  rash  enough  or  unfortunate  enough 
to  attempt  penetrating  into  their  fastnesses.  Two 
foolhardy  English  sailors  are  said  to  have  furnished 
the  last  examples.  They  departed,  determined  to 
ascend  ""  le  Grros  Piton,""  and  never  were  heard  of 
more.  However,  all  things  considered,  I  used  that 
discretion  said  to  be  the  better  part  of  valour,  and 
can  only  indulge  the  hope  that  it  is  ""  distance  lends 
enchantment  to  the  view.""  We  entered  the  bay  of 
St.  Thomas  this  evening,  now  become  a  familiar 
scene.  To-morrow  we  set  out  on  our  southern  expedition ;  and  as  the  ""  Parana""  sails  for  England  again 
early  in  the  morning,  I  shall  send  you  this  letter 
by  her. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 

C. "
40,"Navy  Bay,  January  27th. — My  dear  Father, — 
After  a  voyage  of  nearly  a  week's  duration,  we 
landed  here  about  midday.  Though  but  a  small 
place  (in  point  of  size,  indeed,  it  is  scarcely  more 
than  a  village),  this  enjoys  the  distinction  of  having 
no  less  than  three  names :  Navy  Bay  by  the  English, 
Colon  by  the  Spanish,  Aspinwall  by  the  Americans, 
are  the  appellations  severally  bestowed  on  it.  The 
aspect  of  the  town  is  singular.  The  houses  look  like 
a  collection  of  booths,  or  those  cardboard  houses 
made  for  children's  toys,  into  the  very  midst  'of 
which,  as  I  was  contemplating  the  scene,  came 
shrieking  and  whirling  the  Panama  train,  with  its 
odd  reverse-looking  chimney,  bringing  back  vividly 
to  my  recollection  the  cars  of  the  ""  blessed  States."" 
We  are  about  to  bid  adieu  for  a  time  to  the  Atlantic 
and  the  ""  Bonnie  Dee  ""  here,  and  to  try  our  fortunes 
on  the  Pacific.  As  we  have  but  a  short  time  to  spare, 
I  shall  send  you  the  diary  I  have  written  since 
leaving  St.  Thomas ;  meanwhile  I  must  try  and  get 
some  information  concerning  things  in  general,  connected with  our  future  movements.  It  seems  very 
strange  that  notwithstanding  the  pretty  constant 
communication  which  now  takes  place  between  the 
two  sides  of  the  Isthmus,  so  little  intelligence 
can  be  obtained  about  the  South  Pacific  route. 
All  that  I  can  positively  make  out  is,  that  the 
steamboats  bound  for  Lima  and  Valparaiso  leave 
Panama  on  the  7th  and  21st  of  each  month ;  but 
for  all  details  I  must  wait  till  we  are  across  the 
Isthmus. 

On  the  21st  of  January  we  left  St.  Thomas  at  daylight, a  very  high  wind,  almost  a  gale,  blowing.  In 
a  few  hours  we  were  out  of  sight  of  land. 

24th. — We  were  aroused  this  morning  before 
five  o'clock,  in  order  to  see  the  sun  rise  upon  the 
Sierra  Nevada,  and  to  enjoy  the  first  sight  of  the 
continent  of  South  America.  I  could  just  discern 
the  snow  edging  the  sharp  summits  of  the  mountain chain  ;  but  unfortunately  the  sun,  although 
generally  rather  too  bright  than  too  dim  in  these 
climes,  was  to-day  enveloped  in  vapour  and  mist, 
and  although  he  went  through  the  ceremony  of 
rising,  he  lacked  the  brilliancy  which  usually  distinguishes him.  This  Sierra  Nevada  is  a  branch  of 
the  great  chain  of  the  Andes,  and  is  called  La 
Sierra  de  Santa  Martha,  at  the  town  of  which  we 
arrived  about  10  A.M.,  and  anchored  in  the  bay.  I 
was  both  surprised  and  delighted  at  the  magnificent 
spectacle  which  met  my  eyes  on  going  on  deck.  Not 
having  heard  any  one  talk  of  or  praise  Santa  Martha 
particularly,  I  was  totally  unprepared  for  such  a 
scene.  I  think  the  voyage  well  worth  the  trouble 
between  St.  Thomas  and  this,  even  were  we  to  see 
nothing  else.  Hills  that  without  any  exaggeration 
might  well  be  called  mountains  rise  straight  up  from 
the  water's  edge.  The  waves  dash  themselves  in 
fury  against  the  rocky  shore,  whilst  all  around,  far  as 
the  eye  can  reach,  peak  rises  above  peak,  of  every 
imaginable  form,  till  they  are  gradually  lost  in  the 
clouds.  Captain  Parker  allowed  us  time  to  go  on 
shore,  and  we  took  a  walk  all  about  the  town  for  upwards of  an  hour.  But  there  is  literally  nothing  to 
be  seen  in  it ;  even  the  cathedral  was  closed,  and  the 
whole  place  seemed  deserted.  The  heat  of  Santa 
Martha  surpasses  all  I  ever  experienced  or  suffered 
elsewhere.  After  perambulating  the  town  for  as  long 
as  we  were  able  to  endure  baking,  we  took  boat 
again,  and  returned  home  to  the  ""  Dee,""  when  we 
gladly  accepted  the  refreshment  of  some  iced  champagne and  seltzer-water  after  our  fatiguing  excursion. 
It  is  blowing  tremendously,  but  I  understand  it  is  by 
no  means  unusual  weather  on  this  part  of  the  coast. 
We  proceeded  on  our  voyage  at  sunset  to-day,  and 
hope  to  reach  Cartagena  in  the  morning.  We  have 
left  at  Santa  Martha  a  large  party  who  had  made  the 
voyage  from  St.  Thomas  with  us, — an  English  merchant and  his  family,  who  are  going  to  settle  at 
Bogota.  They  expect  to  reach  the  latter  in  eight 
days.  They  will  have  several  hundred  miles'  travelling on  the  great  Magdalena  river,  but  I  should  fear 
will  meet  many  difficulties,  as,  besides  a  tolerably 
numerous  party  in  themselves,  children,  and  servants, 
they  comprehend  a  small  edition  of  Noah's  ark, 
horses,  dogs,  cows,  sheep,  poultry;  also  carriages, 
carts,  saddles,  and  bridles. 

25th. — We  did  not,  after  all,  arrive  at  Cartagena 
until  nearly  five  o'clock  P.M.,  for  although  the  wind 
was  fair  it  was  anything  but  light,  and  the  swell  was 
tremendous.  I  was  not  sorry  for  the  delay,  however, 
as  it  enabled  us  to  see  by  daylight  what  is  generally 
passed  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  namely,  the  mouth 
of  the  great  river  Magdalena.  As  I  unfortunately 
missed  ""  the  father  of  waters ""  in  the  north,  the 
Mississippi,  being  too  ""  yellow-feverish,""  I  am  glad 
at  least  to  have  the  opportunity  of  beholding  one  of 
the  principal  South  American  rivers.  One  would 
hardly  guess  the  Magdalena  at  its  embouchure, 
however,  to  be  anything  but  a  lake :  indeed,  it  is 
difficult  at  first  to  distinguish  it  from  the  ocean  which 
it  joins.  Our  first  view  of  Cartagena  was  just  ""in 
the  light  of  declining  day.""  From  the  sea  its  appearance is  very  fine,  and  greatly  reminded  me  of 
the  appearance  of  Venice  from  the  lagunes.  In  order 
to  enter  the  harbour  of  Cartagena  a  great  detour 
must  be  made,  by  which,  to  all  appearance,  the  city 
is  left  far  behind.  We  steamed  along  a  narrow 
channel  called  the  Boca  Chica,  or  little  mouth,  and 
after  proceeding  for  about  nine  miles,  but  in  perfectly smooth  water,  in  an  exactly  contrary  direction 
to  our  previous  course,  we  suddenly  found  ourselves 
in  the  bay,  where  our  good  ship  speedily  anchored 
herself.  A  very  curious  hill  or  mountain  rises  immediately above  this  town,  and  is  called  the  ""  Popa,"" 
from  its  resemblance  to  the  prow  of  a  ship.  We 
have  not  been  able  to  see  much  of  the  city  of  Cartagena, as,  by  the  time  the  indispensable  preliminaries 
were  settled  attendant  on  the  arrival  of  the  packet, 
the  mails  landed,  and  matters  in  order,  it  was 
sunset.  We  went  on  shore,  however,  and  were  introduced by  Captain  Parker  to  the  English  Consul,  Mr. 
Kortright,  with  whom  we  spent  the  evening ;  he  has 
a  delightful  house,  with  a  gallery  going  round  it, 
whence  one  looks  down  upon  the  most  refreshing 
green  shrubs  and  brilliant-hued  flowers :  and  apropos 
of  hues,  he  possesses  a  beautiful  and,  I  should  think, 
most  valuable  collection  of  birds  all  netted  here,  that 
is  to  say  in  New  Granada,  of  which  republic  Cartagena is  the  seaport,  and  Bogota  the  capital.  It  is 
scarcely  possible  to  imagine  or  believe,  without  seeing,  the  wonderful  variety  of  shades  and  tints,  shining 
and  sparkling  like  gems,  on  the  wings  of  these  lovely 
creatures.  I  must  not  omit  to  mention  also  a  very 
magnificent  preserved  butterfly,  which  was  under  a 
glass  shade,  ornamenting  Mr.  Kortright's  drawing- 
room  table,  measuring  upwards  of  twelve  inches  from 
wing  to  wing,  of  a  glowing  cobalt-blue  colour,  spotted 
with  silver.  Our  host  has  kindly  volunteered  to 
show  us  some  of  the  lions  of  Cartagena  to-morrow 
morning,  provided  the  powers  that  rule  the  ""  Dee  "" 
and  her  movements  should  be  propitious  and  allow 
us  a  few  hours ;  or  if  not,  the  engagement  is  to  hold 
good  on  our  return  next  month. 

26th. — We  were  obliged  to  relinquish  our  intended 
drive  into  the  country  this  morning,  as  the  ""  Dee  "" 
was  up,  steam  and  all,  betimes,  and  we  got  under  way 
between  eight  and  nine  A.M.  Wind  still  high,  and 
the  swell  great,  but  not  quite  so  bad  as  it  has  been.— 
To  resume  my  letter.  We  have  now  located  ourselves for  to-day  at  the  ""  City  Hotel,""  a  wonderful 
structure  made  entirely  of  wood,  not  thicker  than 
pasteboard.  I  do  not  at  all  fancy  sleeping  in  such  a 
place,  for  fear  of  its  catching  fire.  Nevertheless  we 
shall  be  under  the  necessity  of  doing  so  for  one  night. 
We  have  just  been  introduced  to  a  Mr.  Stevenson, 
the  stepson  of  Mr.  Cowan,  the  English  Consul.  He 
is  going  to-morrow,  and  has  kindly  undertaken  to 
chaperone  us  in  our  journey  across  the  Isthmus.  So 
now  farewell.  I  will,  if  all  be  well,  send  you  a  letter 
from  Panama.  The  heat  here  is  intense,  far  greater 
than  we  have  yet  experienced  anywhere  in  the  course 
of  our  wanderings. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 
C. "
41,"January  28th,  Navy  Bay. — My  dear  Father, — Although I  shall  not  send  this  letter  till  we  are  on  the 
other  side  of  the  Isthmus,  I  shall  resume  my  notes 
at  once,  partly  for  occupation's  sake,  especially  during 
this  long  day  of  waiting  here.  Shortly  after  the 
despatch  of  my  last,  the  signal  for  sailing  was  made, 
and  at  length  came  the  parting  hour,  when  the 
friends  and  companions  of  many  a  weary  mile  were 
to  leave  us,  and  the  farewell  was  spoken.  I  can 
hardly  describe  to  you  the  feeling  of  desolation 
which  we  experienced  for  a  short  period  as  we 
watched  the  ""  Dee  ""  till  she  gradually  faded  out  of 
sight,  then  turned  to  find  ourselves  quite  alone, 
standing  between  two  oceans  and  two  continents. 
Our  solitary  reflections  were,  however,  soon  unceremoniously interrupted  by  the  clamorous  tones  of  the 
dinner  bell,  and  being  driven  in  to  feed  in  a  style  more 
than  ever  reminding  me  of  the  States.  By  the  time 
we  reached  the  dinner-room  we  found  the  hungry 
claimants  had  already  nearly  cleared  the  tables,  and 
very  shortly  after  they  had  vanished  from  the  scene 
as  well  as  the  food,  with  a  celerity  which  had  something of  the  miraculous. 

29th. — Embarked  on  the  railroad,  though  in  rather 
a  novel  mode  of  conveyance,  namely,  the  baggage 
waggon.  But  it  was  Sunday,  and  the  good  Yankees 
were  too  good  to  accommodate  passengers  with  a  carriage on  that  day,  though  they  sent  a  luggage  car  ;  but 
then  if  they  had  not  done  that,  sundry  dollars  would 
have  been  sacrificed,  and  so  they  pocketed  their  principles to  the  extent  of  forwarding  the  ""  Dee's  ""  cargo, 
and  also  allowed  us  by  a  great  favour,  and  in  consideration of  our  paying  first-class  prices,  to  sit  on  our 
boxes  in  the  said  waggon.  We  preferred  doing  this, 
however,  and  having  the  advantage  of  Mr.  Stevenson's 
escort,  to  waiting  till  the  next  day,  and  coming  with  the 
crush  of  Californians  who  were  expected  to  arrive  by 
the  American  steamer.  The  road  is  a  narrow  cutting 
through  heavy  masses  of  damp  rich-looking  jungle, 
with  interminable  forests  spreading  far  and  wide  in  the 
distance,  and  all  covered  and  interlaced  with  the  same 
sort  of  beautiful  creepers  and  parasites  we  had  so  much 
admired  in  Mexico.  In  about  two  hours  we  reached 
a  small  ""  station  ""  or  settlement,  consisting  of  two  or 
three  small  Indian  huts  called  Caravali.  Here  we 
left  the  railroad,  which  however  is  open  some  distance further  (as  far  as  Grorgona);  but  our  chaperon 
having  his  own  boat,  and  always  employing  this 
means  of  conveying  the  silver  and  ""  treasure/'  as  it 
is  called,  with  which  he  is  intrusted  by  the  company, 
we  embarked  with  him  on  the  river  Chaores. 


During  the  delay  which  took  place  here  while  the 
cargo  was  being  shipped,  we  had  an  amusing  scene. 
The  wildness  and  novelty  of  the  whole  affair  induced 
me  to  attempt  a  little  sketch.  First  came  ourselves 
seated  on  a  plank  under  the  shade  of  a  tree,  then  the 
winding  river,  the  odd-shaped  canoes,  and  the  all 
but  naked  boatmen,  some  sleeping,  a  few  working, 
some  eating,  and  others  taking  sudden  plunges  into 
the  water  and  diving  like  ducks.  Close  to  ourselves 
the  occupations  were  still  more  varied.  The  extraordinary-looking Indian  women  were  several  of  them 
cooking  soup  and  other  savoury  messes  on  a  very 
primitive  sort  of  batterie  de  cuisine,  consisting  of  a 
few  sticks  laid  on  a  few  stones,  and  a  black  mysterious- 
looking  cauldron  crowning  the  whole  edifice,  out  of 
which  pot-luck  was  doled  to  all  suppliants  by  the 
various  artistes, — I  cannot  call  them  ""  fair,""  as  their 
complexions  varied  from  a  bright  chocolate  colour  to 
the  deepest  jet.  But  their  costume  was  truly  unique — 
full-dress  low  bodices  and  short  sleeves  to  their  gowns, 
their  woolly  locks  hanging  in  wild  luxuriance  about 
their  necks  and  shoulders,  and  profusely  ornamented 
with  natural  flowers,  beads,  combs,  gold  and  silver. 
By  way  of  variety,  another  group,  composed  of  some 
half-dozen  people,  were  occupied  playing  cards  as  if 
for  their  lives,  so  intent  were  they  on  their  game. 
These  looked  especially  picturesque,  as,  in  order  to 
shield  themselves  from  the  burning  rays  of  the  sun, 
they  had  thrown  a  boat's  sail  over  three   or   four 
poles,  and  under  its  shade  they  had  encamped  themselves.    I  had  begun  to  try   and   sketch  with  my 
pencil  a  few  of  the  principal  points  in  this  tableau, 
when  one  or  two  of  the  Indians  having  perceived 
what  I  was  about,  gave  utterance  to  some  exclamations of  astonishment,  which  speedily  attracted  the 
whole  community   round   me,   and  then   ensued   a 
really  laughable  scene,  which,  I  take  it,  quite  exemplifies the  vanity   inherent  in  our   human   nature. 
They  all,  men  as  well  as  women  and  children,  began 
to  put  themselves  into  what  they  considered  the  most 
engaging  and  favourable   attitudes,   and   begged  I 
would  take  their  likenesses.     At  last,  the  boat  being 
ready,  we   embarked  in  it,   and   had   a   somewhat 
tedious  voyage  up  the  river  for  five  hours  to  Cruces, 
which  is  to  be  our  halting  place  for  the  night.     The 
mode  used  in  navigating  the  Chagres,  is  poling,  a 
most  laborious  as  well  as  slow  proceeding,  but  I  suppose it  must  be  the  only  feasible  plan,  as  surely,  were 
another  method  practicable,  it  would  have  been  tried 
before  now.     Notwithstanding  this  disadvantage,  it 
must  be  owned  that  the  scenery,  and  all  surrounding 
the  banks  of  the  river  Chagres,  is  so  wonderful  and 
so  interesting  in  its  own  peculiar  style,  that  were  the 
discomforts  and  drawbacks  ten  times  worse  than  they 
actually  are,  I  think  the  voyage  well  worth  the  experiment. The  sun  I  must  own  was  almost  overpowering :  it  is  a  wonder  we  did  not  get  a  stroke, 
being  exposed  to  five  hours'  unceasing  blaze.  I  never 
before  to-day  completely  realised  ""  the  deep  silence 
of  a  noontide  forest.""  *  Far  as  the  eye  could  reach 
over  hill  and  over  plain,  before  and  around,  spread 
the  undulating  but  unbroken  surface  of  the  tropical 
woods,  looking  like  some  vast  petrified  ocean  (I  was 
going  to  say  frozen,  but  the  idea  of  ice  in  such  a 
scene  would  be  too  ""  far  fetched  "").  Then  the  stillness, not  a  breath,  not  a  sound  was  heard,  save  what 
was  caused  by  ourselves,  and  that  was  but  little,  for 
it  was  too  hot  to  talk  or  to  move  unnecessarily, 
therefore  the  only  actual  token  of  life  was  the  measured plashing  of  the  pole  in  the  water  drawing  us 
slowly  along.  We  had  proceeded  thus  for  a  couple 
of  hours  when  we  experienced  an  interruption  of  a 
very  curious  nature,  and  which,  owing  to  the  incongruity it  presented  to  all  that  had  gone  before,  will 
not  be  speedily  forgotten.  Our  boat  suddenly  stopped at  the  entrance  to  a  little  creek,  when  there  appeared by  the  river  side  —  a  woman!  with  a  child  of 
between  four  and  five  years  old.  One  would  have 
imagined  she  had  dropped  from  the  skies,  did  the 
inhabitants  of  the  celestial  regions  dress  in  the  style 
of  this  lady ;  but  where  on  the  surface  of  the  earth 
she  did  come  from,  was  certainly  neither  to  be  seen 
nor  conceived.  She  wore  a  pale  yellow  dress  of  crape 
gauze,  or  some  equally  light  material,  with  several 
blonde  flounces  of  most  elaborately  designed  patterns, 
Over  her  shoulders  was  thrown  a  shawl,  bright  blue 
in  colour,  and  also  of  some  light  material,  while 
neck,  arms,  and  head  shone  resplendent  with  jewels 
(chiefly  diamonds)  and  flowers.  To  complete  the 
picture,  she  held  in  her  hands  some  articles  of  furniture generally  supposed  to  belong  rather  to  the 
bedroom  than  the  public  conveyance.  I  wish  the 
climate  had  been  cooler.  I  should  have  so  much 
liked  to  enter  into  conversation  with  her  ;  but  it  was 
too  hot,  and  as  she  did  not  utter  a  word,  I  feared 
that  even  if  I  tried  Spanish,  I  should  not  be  successful as  the  patois  are  many  and  various.  We 
found  ourselves  equally  lethargic  when,  a  little  later, 
the  boatmen  darted  quickly  across  the  river  in  pursuit of  an  unhappy  iguano,  which  they  espied  basking 
in  the  sun.  Having  caught  the  poor  victim,  they 
tied  him  up,  fastening  the  claws  behind  the  back,  and 
so  carried  him  in  triumph,  preparatory  to  cooking 
and  eating  him.  In  point  of  size,  the  iguano  seems 
to  be  midway  between  a  large  lizard  and  a  small 
alligator.  The  flesh  is  considered  in  these  parts  a 
table  delicacy.  At  length  we  reached  our  haven, 
Cruces,  a  villanous  looking  little  place.  On  disembarking, we  walked  through  the  village,  a  collection 
of  tumble  down  log  huts,  till  we  arrived  at  our  sleeping quarters,  the  huts  so  called.  Here  I  cannot  say 
we  slept,  but  we  passed  the  night.  Besides  the 
agreeable  sight  of  monstrous  spiders,  innumerable 
in  quantity,  attached  to  the  walls  and  ceiling  of  our 
rooms,  scorpions  were  more  than  suspected ;  and  to 
crown  all,  we  were  gratified  by  hearing  a  mysterious 
hissing  during  the  whole  night,  which  the  next 
morning  we  were  informed  was  produced  by  snakes. 
A  pleasant  and  enj oy able  residence  certainly!  Among 
other  discomforts  we  were  starved ;  there  was  absolutely nothing  to  eat ;  no  bread,  no  fresh  meat,  only 
some  dried  beef,  which  was  totally  unmanageable, 
and  there  was  not  even  chocolate ;  but  by  way  of 
compensation,  there  was  any  quantity  of  claret  and 
brandy :  so,  although  we  were  faint  from  want  of  food, 
we  were  obliged  to  bear  the  deprivation  as  best  we 
could,  and  at  ten  o'clock  on  the  morning  of  the  30th 
we  mounted  our  mules  to  accomplish  the  rest  of  the 
Isthmus  passage,  a  distance  of  about  twenty-one 
miles.  From  the  different  accounts  I  had  heard 
and  read  of  the  perils  and  dangers  of  the  road,  I  had 
gone  fully  prepared  for  no  end  of  catastrophes  and 
adventures  of  all  kinds,  and  consequently  I  was 
really  half  disappointed  to  find  so  little  need  for  all 
rny  powers  of  endurance.  To  begin  with  the  road  : 
there  was  scarcely  a  single  spot  on  our  path  to-day  that 
I  would  not  have  ridden  even  a  good  English  horse 
over ;  and  with  our  little  Mexican  steeds  we  should 
easily  have  gone  over  the  ground  in  less  than  half 
the  time  it  took  us  toiling  and  jogging  on  these 
indolent  mules.  There  must,  however,  be  some 
wonderful  difference  caused  by  even  a  day's  rain. 
We,  with  our  usual  good  fortune  in  the  way  of 
weather,  have  had  nothing  but  i(  plenty  too  much '"" 
sunshine  all  the  way.  And  it  seems  impossible  that 
every  one  should  concur  in  describing  the  difficulties 
of  the  passage  as  so  great,  were  there  not  some 
grounds  for  apprehension.  I  remember,  too,  Lord 
S.  (whose  correct  and  graphic  account  of  the  rest  of 
the  trip  has  been  most  invaluable  to  me)  mentions 
that,  at  nearly  every  step,  his  mule  got  up  to  its  neck 
in  a  bog  or  quagmire  of  some  sort.  Certainly  a  very 
different  state  of  things  to  what  we  experienced, 
everything  being  dry,  parched,  and  burning.  After 
about  eight  hours'  slow  progress,  we  at  length  gained 
the  summit  of  a  hill,  from  whence  the  broad  Pacific, 
the  islands,  and  the  beautiful  bay  and  town  of  Panama 
burst  upon  our  sight.  It  would  be  hard  to  find  a 
more  lovely  view  as  it  ""  shone  in  the  light  of  declining day."" 

3lst,  Panama. — Our  ideas  of  rest  and  peace,  if 
we  had  any,  were  but  rudely  dispelled  on  arriving 
here.  We  had  been  a  little  prepared  during  our 
passage  of  the  Isthmus,  by  encountering  from  time 
to  time  some  parties  of  frightfully  uncouth  and 
savage-looking  people  (who  all  asked  us  an  infinite 
number  of  questions),  for  a  certain  amount  of  annoyance and  discomfort  on  a  nearer  acquaintance  with 
the  Californians.  But,  alas  !  the  reality  far  surpassed 
our  imaginations.  We  had  the  ill  luck  to  fall  into 
the  cross  tide  of  gold  diggers  to  the  number  of  upwards of  1600  savages  just  landed  simultaneously  on 
either  side  of  the  Isthmus.  No  tongue  and  no  pen 
could  do  them  justice ;  their  appearance  was  scarcely 
human,  and  as  to  their  manners,  I  must  renounce  all 
attempts  to  give  an  account  of  them.  One  small 
item  I  shall  note  down  as  being  the  first  specimen. 
On  leaving  my  bed-room  at  the  hotel,  and  coming 
into  the  public  (called  par  excellence  the  ladies') 
saloon.  I  found  tables,  sofas,  and  floor  covered  with 
bones,  fat,  and  sundry  other  remains  of  food,  which 
the  savages,  whose  shouts  and  whooping  had  been  disturbing me  for  two  hours  previously,  had  been  devouring without  other  implements  than  those  already provided  by  nature,  namely  tooth  and  nail. 
Fortunately  I  had  a  letter  of  introduction  to  Mr.  and 
Madame  Hurtado  (the  latter  is  the  daughter  of  Mr. 
Perry,  our  consul  here),  and,  thanks  to  their  kindness 
and  hospitality,  we  are  enabled  to  avoid  the  annoyances  of  this  hotel  during  the  day,  as  we  are  invited 
to  take  our  meals  and  spend  the  day  with  them,  as 
long  as  we  remain  at  Panama.  But  the  nights  are 
unendurable;  no  sleep,  no  peace.  Moreover,  the 
charges  are  positively  ridiculous.  For  one  wretched 
little  room  containing  a  bed  and  a  half,  the  half 
being  a  bed  without  a  mosquito  net,  which  constitutes by  far  the  most  important  moiety  in  these 
parts,  one  cracked  water  jug  and  basin,  and  one 
looking  glass,  they  demand  the  preposterous  sum  of 
five  dollars  a  night ;  food,  lights,  &c.,  extra. 

February  1st.  —  This  morning  we  visited  the 
cathedral,  almost  the  only  building  worthy  of  notice 
in  the  town  which  is  not  gone  to  decay.  It  is  a  fine 
old  edifice,  with  some  good  specimens  of  sculpture. 
There  are  many  other  ruined  churches,  convents,  and 
houses,  all  bearing  traces  of  much  past  grandeur  and 
magnificence.  But  the  great  charm  of  Panama  is 
the  scenery.  All  around,  the  bay,  the  sea,  the  sky, 
the  distant  mountains,  all  is  enchanting,  far  more 
like  the  Greek  islands  than  any  other  part  of  the 
world  I  have  seen  since  leaving  them. 

3rd. — We  find  that  the  steamer  for  the  south  does 
not  leave  here  until  the  7th  of  this  month,  consequently we  have  decided  on  going  to  the  island  of 
Taboga  for  the  time  yet  to  elapse,  so  we  shall  go 
there  to-morrow.  One  very  great  pleasure  I  have 
enjoyed  since  coming  here,  which  has  gone  far  to 
make  up  for  the  disagreeables  of  the  hotel.  Every 
night  in  walking  back  from  Mr.  Hurtado's,  I  have 
paused  to  gaze  on  the  Southern  Cross  shining  in  all 
its  splendour  above  us. 

4th,  Taboga.  —  On  board  the  E.  M.  S.  ship 
Bogota.  We  have  been  very  kindly  received  by 
Captain  Hall  the  commander  of  this  beautiful 
vessel,  and  allowed  to  take  up  our  quarters  on  board 
at  once,  instead  of  stopping  on  shore.  I  am  greatly 
pleased  with  this  island,  the  air  is  fresher  and  cooler 
than  at  Panama,  and  yet  we  have  the  beautiful  view 
of  the  bay  and  surrounding  country.  We  went  this 
afternoon  on  a  shilling  expedition  on  the  golden 
sands  of  Taboga ;  we  picked  up  some  beautiful  and 
rare  specimens.  The  Pacific  coast  is  very  famous  for 
its  conchological  (if  there  be  such  a  word)  productions. Not  very  far  distant  are  the  Pearl  Islands, 
whence  a  considerable  trade  is  obtained  from  the 
pearl  fishery.  At  Panama,  I  saw  several  very 
curiously  wrought  ornaments,  in  seed  pearl  and 
gold  filagree,  which  had  the  advantage  at  least  of 
being  very  uncommon;  also  the  famous  Panama 
chains  of  pure  unalloyed  gold,  flexible  as  a  blade  of 
grass. 

Qth. — The  Bogota  returned  to  Panama  to  receive 
the  mails  and  passengers ;  we  have  therefore  come  on 
shore  to  spend  the  day  with  the  Hurtados.  We  set 
out  on  our  travels  once  more  to  morrow.  As  I  do  not 
know  when  the  next  opportunity  of  sending  you  any 
tidings  will  be,  I  shall  post  this  now  here,  and  until 
we  arrive  at  Lima  will  write  a  journal  of  all  that 
occurs.  In  the  mean  time  I  am  ever  your  affectionate 

C."
42,"Panama,  February  7th,  6  r.M.  —  We  have  just 
quitted  the  harbour,  my  dear  Father,  on  our  southern 
voyage ;  weather  fine,  but  excessively  hot.  A  very 
disagreeable  incident  occurred  yesterday  evening  on 
board  this  vessel,  which  has  caused  me  great  vexation ;  a  morocco  travelling  case  of  mine,  which  I 
valued  highly,  not  on  account  of  its  own  worth,  but 
because  it  had  belonged  to  my  mother,  was  stolen 
from  my  cabin.  I  immediately  communicated  the 
intelligence  to  the  captain,  and  since  then  everything 
has  been  done  which  was  possible  to  discover  the 
thief  or  get  the  case  restored,  but  as  yet  without 
effect.  I  have  offered  a  reward  of  100  dollars,  and 
no  questions  asked,  if  it  is  returned  to  me ;  and  Captain Hall,  by  my  persuasion,  has  promised  pardon  to 
the  culprit  if  he  will  now  confess ;  or,  as  there  might 
be  a  feeling  of  shame  connected  with  his  comrades 
were  he  to  own  he  was  a  robber,  a  particular  spot  in 
the  ship  will  be  visited  twice  a  day,  and  if  the  case  is 
put  there  no  inquiries  will  be  made.  In  the  meantime  the  officers  of  the  ship  are  told  off-  in  different 
directions  to  search  the  berths  and  quarters  of  the 
crew. 

8th. — They  have  got  hold  of  a  man  who  acknowledges he  knows  something  of  my  lost  property,  but 
who  is  foolish  enough  to  be  obstinate,  and  refuse  any 
further  explanation.  As  he  bears  a  very  bad  character, and  is  strongly  suspected  to  be  himself  the 
thief,  Captain  Hall  has  given  him  till  midday  to 
confess  what  he  knows  or  has  done,  and  if  he  does 
not  before  that,  he  will  be  put  in  irons.  To  my  consternation the  foolish  man  has  proved  stubborn,  and 
consequently  the  threatened  punishment  has  been 
inflicted.  We  crossed  the  line  at  7  P.M.  this  evening. 
Heat  very  great,  though  perhaps  not  quite  so  violent 
as  I  expected.  The  days  are  gone  by  now  when 
crossing  the  line  was  an  event  celebrated  by  a  mimic 
visit  from  Neptune.  Now  the  fact  was  merely  stated, 
and  we  found  ourselves  sans  ceremonie  in  the 
southern  hemisphere. 

Wth. —  I  am  happy  to  say  that  the  prisoner  has 
made  a  confession,  and,  above  all,  that  my  case  is 
restored  safe  and  sound.  The  reason,  or  more  properly speaking  the  temptation,  which  he  alleged 
prompted  the  theft  he  has  now  disclosed.  I  had  been 
a  good  deal  puzzled  about  this  part  of  the  business,  as 
I  had  not  lost  anything  which  would  fetch  any  money 
to  speak  of ;  but  it  seems  that,  during  the  few  days 
we  had  spent  on  board  the  ship  at  Taboga,  my  proceedings had  been  watched,  and  by  this  means  the 
man  had  discovered  that  I  was  in  the  habit  of  keeping my  purse  and  a  small  box  containing  rings  (one 
of  which  was  a  diamond)  inside  the  stolen  case,  and 
these  were  the  objects  of  his  desire.  Very  fortunately 
for  me,  however,  he  had  not  observed  that  every 
evening,  on  going  to  dress  for  dinner  at  six  o'clock, 
I  put  the  rings  on  my  fingers  and  the  purse  in  my 
pocket,  the  latter  because  we  generally  played  at 
vingt-un  every  night  between  tea  and  bedtime ;  and 
from  not  having  noticed  this  he  abstracted  the  case 
at  eight  o'clock.  Had  he  taken  it  during  the  day, 
both  ornaments  and  money  would  then  have  gone,  I 
fear,  irretrievably.  As  it  was,  the  only  loss  I  have 
sustained  is  that  of  three  or  four  very  long  letters 
addressed  to  people  at  home,  and  which  were  all 
ready  sealed  and  prepared  for  departure,  and  these 
the  thief  very  wantonly  threw  into  the  sea  instead  of 
the  post.  Very  fortunately,  your  letter  escaped,  from 
my  having  written  it  while  on  shore.  But  ""  all's  well 
that  ends  well,""  and  I  am  pleased  enough  to  have 
escaped  so  well.  The  next  thing  will  be  to  prevail 
on  Captain  Hall  to  pardon  and  set  free  the  delinquent, whose  stupidity  I  think  far  exceeds  his  criminality. The  idea  of  letting  himself  be  found  out, 
when,  according  to  the  bargain,  he  might  have 
restored  the  case  to  me  with  or  without  making  any 
explanation,  and,  unquestioned,  would  have  received 
100  dollars  !  Now  that  my  mind  is  easy  on  this 
subject  I  can  take  time  to  chronicle  an  incident 
which  took  place  on  the  morning  of  our  departure 
from  Panama,  and  which  might  have  rendered  it  a 
matter  of  indifference  whether  the  morocco  case  was 
found  or  not.  Much  against  my  inclination  and 
judgment,  I  was  persuaded  to  join  a  party  in  a  sailing- 
trip  along  the  coast  and  bay,  and  for  this  purpose  we 
embarked  in  a  small  cutter  under  the  command  of  a 
gentleman  whose  name  I  will  not  mention,  but  who 
confessed  he  had  never  been  in  anything  but  a  steamboat on  the  Pacific,  and  in  this  particular  Bay  of 
Panama  knew  nothing  of  the  currents,  swells,  or  any 
other  peculiarities  which  might  belong  to  it.  This 
was  not  the  most  agreeable  intelligence  we  could 
have  received  when  about  a  hundred  yards  from  the 
steamer.  With  the  rashness  and  foolhardiness  of 
ignorance,  however,  he  proceeded  to  crowd  every 
morsel  of  sail  he  could  get  hold  of  on  the  unlucky 
little  boat,  and,  worse  still,  had  fastened  the  principal 
sail  as  if  he  had  intended  to  show  off  an  experiment 
at  the  Polytechnic  with  manufactured  perils.  This 
feat  was  scarcely  accomplished  when  over  we  went. 
What  had  exactly  happened  I  know  not,  though  I 
can  form  a  tolerably  good  guess.  On  emerging  from 
a  most  unwelcome  dip  in  the  sea,  I  saw  a  man  with  a 
knife  in  his  hand  (he  was  a  sailor,  not  an  officer), 
having  cut  loose  the  sail,  my  companion  and  myself 
looking  like  drowned  rats,  the  ""commander""  and 
another  gentleman  looking  very  foolish,  and  a  shark 
looking  very  much  disappointed.  So  after  this  the 
rest  of  the  party  agreed  with  me  it  would  be  better 
to  make  no  more  such  experiments,  and  to  be  contented with  rowing  quietly  back.  We  had  not  proceeded long  before  we  met  one  of  the  ship's  boats, 
which  the  chief  officer,  Mr.  Davies,  sent  off  to  our 
assistance,  having  seen  through  his  telescope  that 
something  was  wrong,  though  we  were  too  far  to 
enable  him  to  distinguish  the  precise  nature  of  the 
accident.  Now  to  return  to  the  present.  Before 
midnight  we  entered  the  Guayaquil  Eiver,  passing  on 
our  route  a  most  singular  island,  called  Dead  Man's 
Island,  from  the  extraordinary  resemblance  it  bears 
to  a  dead  person  when  laid  out  previous  to  burial. 

llth,  Guayaquil. — I  had  never  till  now  realised, 
as  the  Americans  would  say,  what  heat  was.  Something quite  indescribable,  and  with  it  all  the  rain  is 
pouring  in  sheets.  All  about  this  territory,  that  is, 
in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  Ecuador  State,  it  very 
rarely  ceases  raining,  while  only  about  a  hundred 
miles  further  down  the  coast  it  never  rains  at  all.  We 
went  on  shore  and  dined  with  the  English  consul  and 
his  family  (Mr.  Cox),  having  previously  walked  about 
the  town  and  looked  at  the  shops,  which  are  not 
particularly  famous.  The.  celebrated  hats  called 
par  excellence  Panama,  are  all  manufactured  here. 
Guayaquil  is  also  very  celebrated  for  grass  hammocks, woven  with  all  sorts  of  pretty  colours.  I  procured one  of  these  as  a  souvenir.  I  must  not  forget 
to  notice  a  production  in  which  I  imagine  no  other 
place  in  the  world  could  vie  with  Guayaquil,  namely, 
mosquitoes.  I  shall  never  forget  the  martyrdom  I 
suffered  during  dinner ;  my  neck,  shoulders,  arms,  and 
feet  are  covered  with  stings .  as  if  I  had  the  measles. 
Owing  to  the  unfortunate  thickness  of  the  atmosphere we  could  not  distinguish  Chimborazo.  We 
saw  the  dim  outline  of  the  Andes,  however,  and  shall 
hope  to  have  better  fortune  another  day  with  Chimborazo, as  in  tolerably  clear  weather  it  is  always 
visible  from  Guayaquil.  En  revanche  for  not  seeing 
him,  we  enjoyed  some  ice  at  dinner  brought  that 
morning  from  his  snowy  peak. 

12th. — Took  our  departure  from  Guayaquil  very 
early  this  morning,  rain  pouring  in  torrents:  passed 
again  Dead  Man's  Island,  and  were  still  more  struck 
with  its  strange  form. 

13th. — Touched  at  Payta,  where,  as  the  steamer 
was  before  her  time,  we  remained  some  hours.  We 
went  on  shore,  and  paid  a  visit  to  the  consul,  Mr. 
Blacker.  This  is  a  most  deserted  looking  spot — nothing but  sand  hills,  and  a  few  houses,  sand  coloured, 
to  be  seen;  nevertheless,  it  is  I  believe  in  a  more 
nourishing  condition  than  it  looks.  From  the  appearance  of  the  sky,  the  inhabitants  were  rather 
anticipating  a  shower  of  rain  —  a  luxury  they  had 
not  enjoyed  for  nine  years  !  We  did  not  stay  long 
enough  to  know  whether  their  wishes  were  gratified 
or  not. 

14th.  —  At  sea  all  day.  Very  early  in  the  morning we  passed  the  Lobos  islands,  of  parliamentary 
and  guano  celebrity.  I  used  often,  when  skimming 
over  the  papers  at  home,  and  the  yarns  they  were 
spinning  about  Lobos,  to  wonder  where  on  earth  it 
was  —  little  expecting  I  should  so  soon  be  on  the 
spot. 

15th.  —  Called  at  a  small  place  called  Pacasmayo 
—  a  very  beautiful  bay  hemmed  in  by  hills  on  every 
side,  and  the  giant  mountains  in  the  distance.  Some 
of  our  fellow  passengers  went  on  shore,  and  brought 
back  with  them  some  most  magnificent  grapes ; 
bunches  which  would  have  gained  a  first  class  prize 
at  the  horticultural  exhibitions. 

16th. —  Touched  at  Gruacho,  another  of  the  numerous ports  on  the  Pacific,  and  finally,  about  one  o'clock 
P.M.,  anchored  in  the  Bay  of  Callao,  a  busy  looking 
place  —  flags  of  all  nations,  and  vessels  of  all  kinds ; 
but  the  sky  was  dim  and  hazy.  It  is  strange  that, 
although  it  never  rains  in  this  land  of  the  children 
of  the  sun,  the  sky  is  by  no  means  generally  clear ; 
and  I  am  told  that  the  bright  and  cloudless  blue,  so 
often  found  in  other  parts  of  the  two  Americas,  is 
here  a  great  rarity.  We  landed  at  half  past  five  P.M. 
at  the  railway  station,  which,  like  that  at  Navy  Bay, 
is  built  at  the  water's  edge.  To  make  up  for  the 
thickness  of  the  atmosphere  when  we  arrived,  there 
was  a  beautiful  sunset,  all  crimson  and  gold,  making 
even  the  sand  hills  and  white  rocks  about  Callao  look 
romantic.  Twenty  minutes'  drive  brought  us  to  the 
goal  of  our  long  journey,  to  Lima  —  the  City  of 
Kings.  As  we  were  accompanied  by  some  of  our 
shipboard  friends,  we  proceeded  on  foot  from  the 
railway  station  to  the  hotel.  The  station,  I  should 
mention,  was  formerly  an  old  convent,  now  tranmogrified into  a  more  worldly  establishment.  The 
first  impression  made  by  Lima,  in  the  little  we  have 
been  able  to  see  this  evening,  is,  that  it  bears  a 
strong  resemblance  to  Mexico.  After  walking  the 
length  of  a  handsome  street,  we  suddenly  emerged 
on  the  Plaza,  and  here  I  could  quite  have  fancied 
myself  back  in  the  Aztec  city.  The  cathedral  occupies one  entire  side  of  the  square,  as  it  does  in 
Mexico  —  but  the  other  three  sides  are  much  gayer 
here.  They  are  called  portales,  are  ranged  in 
arches,  and  something  like  the  Palais  Eoyal  in  point 
of  gay  shops  and  stalls,  with  all  their  wares  spread 
out  in  tempting  array,  and  brilliantly  lighted.  We 
have  housed  ourselves  at  Morin's  hotel  on  the  Plaza. 
The  other  hotel  which  was  most  recommended  is 
quite  full.  There  is  a  general  rush  from  Callao  and 
elsewhere  in  these  parts  to  hear  Catherine  Hayes, 
who  is  to  sing  for  the  last  time  here  to-night.  She 
is  en  route  to  California.  We  were  fortunately  able 
to  procure  a  box,  and  were  soon  gratified  by  hearing the  Barbiere,  Miss  Hayes  of  course  taking  the 
part  of  Rosina.  The  opera  house  is  pretty  enough  ; 
still  nothing  very  remarkable.  But  what  was 
singular,  was  the  almost  exclusive  British  audience, 
so  far  away  from  home !  There  are  many  merchants settled  here  or  in  Callao,  with  their  families  ; 
all  of  whom  I  imagine,  attended  on  this  occasion. 
Then  there  are  two  or  three  ships  belonging  to  our 
navy,  as  well  as  the  packet  service.  And  each  and 
all  of  these  furnished  a  quota  of  dilettanti,  eager  to 
greet  their  countrywoman. 

Having  now  safely  landed,  and  established  ourselves for  a  time  at  Lima,  I  shall  close  this  letter, 
and  hope  to  find  an  opportunity  of  sending  it  shortly. 
I  should  not  wonder  if  you  received  it  via  California, 
as  the  communication  is  much  more  frequent  that 
way  by  St.  Jean  de  Nicaragua,  than  direct  from  here 
to  England  by  Panama. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 
C. "
43,"Lima,  Feb.  17  th.  —  My  dear  Father,— The  first  day 
of  arrival  at  a  resting  place,  however  short  that  rest 
is  to  be,  I  have  hitherto  observed,  is  always  passed 
in  doing  nothing.  To-day  has  formed  no  exception 
to  our  general  course.  After  dinner  we  took  a  stroll 
about  the  town,  looked  at  the  shops,  and  voila  tout. 
These  are  much  finer  than  at  Mexico ;  indeed,  they 
are  so  pretty  as  to  almost  deserve  the  modern  title 
given  to  Lima,  namely,  the  Paris  of  South  America, 
though  I  still  prefer  the  old  one,  Ciudad  de  los 
Keyes,  ""The  City  of  Kings.""  I  have  discovered 
another  great  resemblance  in  Lima  to  Valetta,  as 
well  as  Mexico.  The  Peruvian  and  Maltese  systems 
of  building  covered  balconies,  chiefly  of  glass,  outside every  house,  cause  a  striking  similarity  in  the 
appearance  of  the  two  cities.  The  churches  here 
are  beautiful ;  we  entered  one,  and  were  told  it  was 
""  La  Merced.""  Some  very  rich  carving  round  several 
of  the  altars,  and  the  exterior  architecture  very  fine. 
18th. —  Walked  to  one  of  the  public  promenades 
this  evening,  called  the  Alameda  del  Aepo.  These 
Alamedas,  wherever  one  meets  them,  all  bear  a  strong 
family  likeness  one  to  another,  whether  at  Havana, 
Mexico,  Lima,  or  elsewhere:  the  same  broad  avenue 
for  carriages,  flanked  by  two  narrower  ones  for 
equestrians  and  foot  passengers ;  the  only  difference 
being  in  the  description  of  trees  with  which  they  are 
planted.  In  this  last  respect  Havana  must  literally 
bear  the  palm,  as  there  one  at  least  of  the  paseos  is 
formed  by  palm  trees,  those  fairest  of  the  fair  in  woodland scenery.  On  our  way  we  crossed  the  bridge 
over  the  Eimac,  the  river,  or  stream  which  waters 
the  city,  and  from  which  its  present  name  of  Lima  is 
said  to  have  been  derived,  or  rather  corrupted.  From 
this  bridge  ;  the  view  is,  or  should  be,  a  very  beautiful one ;  but  it  is  seldom  clear,  a  sad  drawback. 

19th.  —  Mr.  Went,  to  whom  I  had  brought  a 
letter  of  introduction,  sent  his  carriage,  and  we  took 
a  drive  to  the  Valley  of  Amancaes,  about  three  miles 
off.  The  same  dull  heavy  sky  above  us,  though  the 
air  was  mild  and  soft.  It  really  is  difficult  to  believe 
that  it  never  rains  here.  All  this  afternoon,  had  I 
been  anywhere  else,  I  should  have  pronounced  a 
drenching  shower  as  quite  inevitable.  Yet  not  a 
drop  came,  and  none  ever  falls :  that  point  all 
agree  in  nem.  con.  But  some  go  as  far  as  to  say 
the  sun  never  shines  :  this  must  be  a  little  exaggerated ;  indeed,  during  the  day,  we  have  had  a  good 
deal :  but  sunshine  without  a  cloud  would  be,  I  suppose, the  miracle.  I  only  wonder  how  the  ancient 
people  of  the  country  came  to  be  sun-worshippers, 
in  a  land  where  they  saw  him  so  little.  From  Amancaes  the  view  of  Lima  is  most  imposing.  Its  numberless domes  and  towers,  rising  from  the  Pacific, 
lying  peacefully  beyond,  reminds  me  of  Byron's 
lines,  speaking  of  Venice  :  — 

""  She  looks  a  sea  Cybele  fresh  from  ocean, 
Rising  with  her  tiara  of  proud  towers  ;"" 

the  strip  of  land  intervening  between  Lima  and 
Callao  not  being  visible  at  this  distance,  and  consequently Lima  looks  as  if,  like  Venice,  she  rose 
from  the  waters.  The  valley  of  Amancaes  itself 
is  a  most  singular-looking  spot,  seemingly  the  bed 
of  an  extinct  volcano,  a  wild  sterile  sort  of  plateau, 
surrounded  by  rocks  and  hills  of  lava  of  every  sort 
of  grotesque  shape,  not  a  shrub  nor  a  blade  of  grass 
to  be  seen.  Then  the  deathlike  stillness  of  the  air 
was  something  awful ;  not  a  sound  to  be  heard.  I 
could  almost  have  fancied  myself  out  of  the  world, 
and  looking  upon  it.  They  say,  however,  that  once 
a  year,  in  the  month  of  June,  Amancaes  bears  a 
different  aspect.  On  or  about  the  festa  of  St.  John, 
namely  the  24th  of  June,  there  suddenly  spring 
up  in  this  desolate  spot  thousands,  millions  of  golden 
coloured  lilies!  This  savours  rather  of  the  marvellous,  but  still  they  say  it  is  true,  and  that  so 
suddenly  does  this  change  occur,  that  what  is  left 
over  night  a  parched  and  blackened  desert,  is  found 
in  the  morning  clothed  in  gold.  We  fancied  as  the 
sun  began  to  set  on  our  return  (by  the  bye,  he  just 
blazed  out  for  about  five  minutes,  in  time  to  allow 
him  to  make  a  decent  exit),  we  thought  we  could 
just  descry  the  peaks  of  the  Cordillera.  I  do  hope 
we  shall  have  one  good  view  of  them  before  leaving. 
20th. — Visited  some  of  the  churches,  accompanied 
by  Mr.  Pearson,  the  English  clergyman.  San 
Domingo  and  the  cathedral  are  both  handsome- 
looking  buildings,  but  unfortunately  there  is  not 
much  reality  in  either  of  them.  This,  however,  is 
inevitable,  as  they  dare  not  build  above  a  certain 
height  with  any  material  more  solid  than  reeds  and 
stucco,  the  earthquakes  are  so  frequent.  One  which 
occurred  here  about  three  weeks  ago  has  nearly 
shaken  off  the  cross  erected  on  one  of  the  domes 
of  the  cathedral,  and  it  now  stands  all  awry.  In 
one  of  the  side  chapels  of  this  last-named  edifice 
there  is  a  shrine  of  carved  cedar  wood,  the  most 
beautiful  specimen  of  workmanship  I  think  I  ever 
saw;  so  fine  and  delicate  that  at  first  I  imagined 
it  was  ivory:  indeed,  even  on  a  nearer  inspection, 
it  more  resembles  ivory,  the  wood  being  of  a  sort 
of  pale  cream  colour ;  and  this  was  carved  into 
wreaths,  garlands,  and  festoons  of  flowers,  intertwined  one  with  another  in  the  most  marvellous 
manner.  The  high  altar  and  some  few  other  parts 
of  the  church  are  still  decorated  with  silver  columns 
and  balustrades;  but,  like  everything  else  in  this 
part  of  the  world,  sadly  shorn  of  its  former  splendour, 
and  fast  hastening  to  decay.  Pizarro  is  said  to  be 
buried  under  the  altar  here.  Strange  that  doubt 
should  exist  on  such  a  subject,  and  I  must  own, 
even  against  my  favourite  Spaniards,  that  it  speaks 
badly  for  their  national  gratitude,  that  the  last 
resting-places  of  the  two  men  to  whom  they  owed 
the  discovery  of  North  and  South  America,  Christopher Columbus  and  Francesco  Pizarro,  should  be 
almost  unknown;  yet  where  their  tombs  are  most 
generally  supposed  to  be,  the  one  in  Havana 
and  the  other  here,  the  small  memorials  that  exist 
should  be  such  wretched  ones.  Here  there  is  more 
excuse,  as  they  have  renounced  their  allegiance 
to  Spain,  and  consequently  they  view  Pizarro's 
memory  with  no  friendly  feelings ;  but  at  Havana 
the  case  is  different,  and  to  Columbus  they  should 
erect  a  more  noble  monument. 

2lst. — Did  not  go  out ;  received  a  few  visits.  Lima 
is  suffering  much  at  this  time  from  an  epidemic 
they  call  peste,  and  nearly  every  house  has  some 
sick  people  in  it,  rendering  everything  very  triste, 
and  the  few  who  are  well  have  all  gone  to  Chorillas, 
a  little  bathing  place  a  couple  of  leagues  from  the 
town.  This  peste  appears  to  be  a  mild  sort 
of  yellow  fever,  and  has  never  appeared  before  in 
Lima,  which  is  generally  reputed  to  be  a  most 
healthy  part  of  the  world,  and  certainly  has  a  most 
delightful  climate,  at  least  to  my  taste.  The  air  is 
warm  without  burning,  and  very  soft. 

22nd. — I  have  for  the  last  two  days  been  making 
what  I  fear  will  turn  out  fruitless  efforts  to  accomplish an  expedition  to  Pachocamac,  to  see  the  ruins 
of  one  of  the  great  temples  of  the  sun.  The  distance 
is  but  twenty-one  miles,  yet  such  is  the  indolence 
of  the  people,  that  if  it  were  one  hundred,  they 
could  not  make  more  difficulties;  to  begin  with, 
they  maintain  that  not  less  than  three  days  are 
necessary  for  the  excursion,  which  really  seems  quite 
ridiculous  for  so  short  a  distance.  'However,  it  is 
no  use  contending  any  more,  and  so  we  must  put 
up  with  riding  out  to-morrow  and  seeing  some  lesser 
ruins  which  are  more  come-at-able.  We  are  fortunate 
enough  to  be  given  a  passage  down  to  Panama  in 
the  Virago,  through  the  good-nature  of  Captain 
Marshall  her  commander.  The  advantages  are  many 
in  this  arrangement.  First,  the  Virago  does  not 
leave  till  Saturday,  a  day  later  than  the  mail  steamer, 
thus  giving  us  a  little  more  time  to  spend  here; 
then  we  shall  avoid  the  numerous  little  ports  along 
the  coast,  which  we  have  already  sufficiently  visited ; 
and  lastly,  we  hope  to  go  into  the  Bay  of  San  Miguel, 
the  starting  point  of  the  Darien  passage,  and  projected canal,  and  this  vessel  contains  the  members 
of  the  far-famed  Darien  expedition. 

23rd. — Visited  the  church  of  San  Pedro  this  morning, which,  though  the  last,  is  the  handsomest  we 
have  yet  seen  ;  the  wood  carvings  in  the  side  chapels 
are  exquisite,  and  there  are  also  some  very  tolerable 
pictures.  We  had  previously  gone  to  the  museum, 
but  it  is  a  very  poor  affair,  the  only  objects  of  any 
interest  being  a  collection  of  the  portraits  of  the 
Incas,  from  the  two  first  children  of  the  sun,  Manco 
Capac  and  his  wife,  down  to  poor  Atahualpa.  It  is 
of  course  to  be  conjectured  that  the  artists  have 
drawn  chiefly  on  their  imaginations,  as  it  must  be 
very  doubtful  that  the  Incas  ever  sat  for  their 
pictures.  There  are  also  a  series  of  paintings  representing the  Spanish  viceroys,  beginning  with 
Pizarro.  Besides  the  portraits,  I  should  mention 
three  or  four  frightful  looking  mummies  which  are 
said  to  be  the  actual  remains  of  some  of  the  Incas  of 
Peru,  but  the  museum  can  boast  of  nothing  more. 
I  am  rejoiced  to  say  that  we  had  this  afternoon  a 
superb  view  of  the  Andes  in  all  their  majesty  and 
brightness.  We  stood  on  the  Eimac  bridge,  and 
clearly  traced  the  long  outline  of  snowy  peaks ;  so 
that  hitherto  unsatisfied  desire  is  now  accomplished, 
and  off  my  mind.  Passed  the  evening  at  the  house 
of  a  lady  to  whom  I  was  introduced  by  a  mutual 
friend,  and  who  is  universally  talked  of  as  ""Mrs. 
Smith  of  Lima.""  I  suppose  it  must  be  from  her 
generous  and  universal  hospitality;  but  to  visit  the 
""  City  of  Kings  ""  and  not  know  Mrs.  Smith,  ""  would 
argue  yourself  unknown,""  besides  being  a  serious  personal privation.  She  has  a  charming  house  filled  with 
curiosities  and  rarities  of  all  descriptions ;  but  above 
all  she  possesses  the  most  astonishing  and  varied 
collection  of  extraordinary  plants  and  flowers.  She 
very  good-naturedly  gave  me  some  rare  specimens 
of  both  flowers  and  leaves  to  preserve.  The  most 
singular  flower  in  her  possession  is  one  named  ""  El 
Espiritu  Santo""  (the  Holy  Spirit),  of  the  Orchid 
species.  It  is  pure  white,  and  in  form  nearly  the 
exact  counterpart  of  a  dove.  I  am  told  the  plant 
is  exceedingly  rare,  not  above  two  or  three  specimens 
being  in  existence.  At  Mrs.  Smith's  house  also  was 
the  celebrated  Madame  Ida  Pfeiffer,  the  female  traveller, a  quiet  mannered  and  still  more  quiet  featured 
little  person.  Physiognomy  is  decidedly  at  fault 
sometimes.  No  one  would  guess,  to  look  at  this 
lady's  impassive  and  rather  expressionless  countenance, 
that  she  either  had  braved  or  was  likely  to  brave 
the  dangers  many  and  great  of  which  she  gives  so 
graphic  an  account  in  her  (f  Voyage  round  the 
World.""  She  is  now  about  to  undertake  a  journey 
in  search  of  the  source  of  the  Amazon.  The  various 
governments  whose  territories  she  explores,  it  must
be  stated  to  their  credit,  give  her  every  assistance 
that  lies  in  their  power,  though  that  is  often  unavailing with  some  of  their  savage  subjects.  Madame 
PfeifTer  has  a  son  living  at  Munich,  a  doctor  by 
profession,  and  a  great  amateur  of  botany  and 

mineralogy.     Mrs.  S tells  me  that,  repeatedly, 

on  being  offered  various  substantial  recompenses 
for  the  benefits  she  has  conferred  by  her  useful 
discoveries  and  explorations,  Madame  Pfeiffer  has 
refused  any  other  guerdon  than  a  plant  or  some  old 
stones  for  the  purpose  of  enriching  the  museum  of 
her  beloved  son.  We  tasted  this  evening  a  liqueur 
called (( Italia,""  made  in  Peru  from  a  grape  originally 
brought  from  Italy ;  hence  the  name.  Notwithstanding which,  the  taste  is  most  decidedly  whiskey-ish. 
Barley  must,  I  am  sure,  be  partly  used  with  the 
grape  in  its  manufacture. 

23rd. — Employed  this  morning  in  shopping.  The 
ancient  palace  of  Pizarro  is  now,  alas!  converted 
into  a  Parisian  looking  ""Passage,""  called  by  the 
modern  Peruvians  ""  Portales.""  Here  vendors  of 
of  ponchos,  gold  and  silver  filigree  work,  sweetmeats, and  other  luxuries  do  congregate.  The 
ponchos  are  generally  handsome ;  they  are  made 
of  the  Vicuna  wool,  soft  to  the  touch  and  brilliant 
in  hue,  but  not  equal  in  my  opinion  to  the  Mexican 
""  serape.""  At  4  p.  M.  we  mounted  our  horses.  Took 
a  circuitous  kind  of  ride  for  the  purpose  of  exploring 
several  ruins;  these  mostly  appear  to  have  been 
temples  to  their  divinity,  or  fortresses,  each  group 
of  buildings  being  more  or  less  surrounded  by  walls 
of  the  Cyclopean  order.  The  great  charm  attaching 
to  ruins  in  the  old  world,  the  Greek  or  the  Eoman  for 
instance,  is  wanting  here,  I  mean  the  broken  column 
or  ""noble  arch  in  proud  decay.""  The  constant 
dread  of  earthquakes  causes  everything  intended  to 
last  to  be  built  low  and  with  a  view  to  durability 
and  solidity  rather  than  beauty.  One  of  our  party 
to-day  who  has  seen  both,  gives  us  the  consolatory 
assurance  that  the  ruins  of  the  temple  of  the  sun 
at  Pachacamac  are  neither  more  extensive  nor  in 
better  preservation  than  these. 

24th.  —  Mounted  again  early  this  morning,  on  an 
excursion  to  Chorillos,  about  nine  miles  distant. 
This  is  the  fashionable  bathing  place  of  Lima ;  and 
whither  at  the  present  moment  all  the  inhabitants  of 
the  city  have  flocked,  in  order  to  be  out  of  the  way 
of  the  peste,  and  to  enjoy  the  air,  which  is  said  to  be 
purer  and  also  cooler  than  at  Lima.  This  last  advantage may  be  the  case,  but  it  does  not  look  so ; 
indeed  I  never  saw  so  apparently  hot  a  looking 
place.  A  collection  of  huts  all  white,  the  rocks 
white,  the  ground  under  foot  white,  and  the  sea  a 
burning  blue.  However,  we  spent  the  morning  here, 
and  saw  the  process  of  bathing.  The  people  of 
both  sexes  go  into  the  water  together  equipped  in  a 
kind  of  bloomer  costume.  The  dressing  rooms  are 
singularly  constructed.  A  number  of  them  stand  on 
the  beach,  and  really  resemble  a  miniature  town. 
They  are  built  of  reeds,  and  are  grouped  in  clusters, 
forming  a  complete  labyrinth.  Each  little  cell  is 
provided  with  the  requisite  linen,  and  articles  necessary to  the  toilette.  In  returning,  we  varied  our 
route,  passing  through  Miraflores,  another,  but  inland 
watering  place;  this,  however,  is  green  and  fresh 
looking,  and  I  should  think  a  much  pleasanter  and 
cooler  summer  residence  than  Chorillos.  Since  we 
have  been  at  Lima,  we  have  had  daily  at  our  dinner 
table  the  most  delicious  potatoes.  The  potato,  if  I 
remember  rightly,  is  by  origin  a  native  of  Peru.  I 
have  never  anywhere  met  with  any  approaching 
these  in  flavour.  It  shows  that  cultivation  does  not 
always  improve,  though  as  in  this  case,  it  may  enlarge. 
'The  Peruvian  potatoes  are  small,  not  much  exceeding a  walnut  in  size,  and  of  a  bright  yellow  colour  — 
very  meally,  and,  as  I  have  said,  most  excellent. 
They  are  served  up  as  the  centre  dish  of  the  table, 
ranged  in  a  pyramid  shape. 

25th.  —  Bade  farewell  to  Lima  at  seven  o'clock 
this  morning,  taking  the  early  train  to  Callao,  where 
we  found  a  boat  from  the  Virago  awaiting  us,  in 
which  we  immediately  embarked,  and  in  a  few 
minutes  were  alongside  of  the  pretty  little  steamer. 
Captain  Marshall  had  invited  the  commander  of  the 
Trincomalee,  Captain  Houston,,  to  join  us  at  breakfast before  we  sailed.  Callao  *  was  looking  far  gayer, 
and  in  all  respects  more  attractive,  than  on  the  day 
of  our  arrival.  This  is  somebody's  birthday,  too,  so 
the  ships  are  dressed  in  all  their  gay  colours.  About 
ten  o'clock  the  signal  was  given,  and  we  were  ""  off, 
off  and  away.""  Finding  myself  again  on  board  a  man 
of  war,  recalls  to  my  mind  the  cruises  in  the  Bay  of 
Naples  which  I  took  some  years  back,  when  the 
English  and  French  fleets  had  gone  there  to  bully 
poor  King  Bomba.  Thfe  Virago  is  a  pretty  neat 
little  vessel,  carrying  six  guns.  She  bears  as  her 
motto  on  a  conspicuous  part  of  her  (but  not  being 
clever  at  nautical  terms,  I  won't  attempt  to  say 
which),  the  words  ""England,  Home,  and  Beauty."" 
There  was  some  imitation  of  the  ceremonies  and 
pranks  which  used  of  yore  to  inaugurate  crossing  the 
line,  on  the  day  when  this  imaginary  boundary 
was  passed.  It  was  made  a  sort  of  holiday  on  board 
the  ship,  and  several  of  the  sailors  enacted  a  sort  of 
masque  or  play,  dressing  themselves  up  as  Neptune 
and  his  satellites,  marine  monsters,  and  a  few  terrestrial donkeys  closed  the  procession,  which  paraded 
the  decks  for  a  considerable  time,  and  saluted  the 
captain  and  officers. 
March  5th. — Anchored  once  more  at  Panama, 
after  a  week's   steaming  from  Callao  —  a  pleasant 
voyage,  delightful  companions,  in  short,  every  thing 
couleur  de  rose.     On  our   way,  we   lay   for   a  few 
hours  off  Guayaquil,  near  the  Dead  Man's   Island. 
I  have  now  heard  another  version  of  the  derivation 
of  this  name,  which  is  in  Spanish,  ""  El  Enamuertajado ; ""  namely,  that  some  years  ago  there  was  an 
intention  of  building  a  lighthouse  on  the  island  to 
guide  vessels  in  their  course  when  near  the  mouth 
of  the  river.     Four  men  were  accordingly  sent,  with 
requisite  building  materials,  and  food  to  support  them 
for  six  months,  by  which  time  the  task  was  to  be 
finished.     In  the  meanwhile  there  occurred  a  ""  Pronunciamento,""  or  revolution,  or  at  any  rate  a  change 
of  government  in  the  Ecuador  State.     Frequent  as 
these  events  are,  one  might  suppose  that  the  general 
business  of  life  would  be  carried  on   in  tile  usual 
manner  ;  but  if  this  tale  be  true,  it  would  seem  that 
the  disturbance  in  question  had  obliterated  the  recollection of  what  had  passed  before.     Time  fled:  the 
six  months  elapsed,  and  no  one  thought  of  the  poor 
builders.     At  length  a  strange  vessel  on  her  way  up 
or  down  the  Pacific,  descried  a  signal  flying  on  the 
barren  isle.     She  bore  down  upon  it,  and  arrived  in 
time  to  hear  the  tale  of  misery  from  one  survivor 
out  of  the  four.     The  rest  had  died  starved  to  death, 
and  this,  the  fourth,  barely  lived  to  complete  his 
history,  but  sunk  under  the  accumulated  hunger  and 
exhaustion  he  had  undergone.  I  cannot  help  hoping, 
however,  that  all  this  is  a  mere  legend  of  romance  ; 
and  I  am  the  more  inclined  to  take  this  view  of  the 
story,  that  the  shape  and  outline  of  the  land  is  so 
unmistakably  like  a  corpse  enveloped  in  a  shroud, 
that  it  would  seem  amply  sufficient  to  account  for  the 
lugubrious  name.  I  had  an  opportunity  of  observing 
on  this  occasion,  what,  owing  to  our  having  landed 
so  immediately  on  our  previous  visit  to  Guayaquil, 
had  then  escaped  me,  viz.  the  curious  water  conveyance employed  by  the  natives  on  this  part  of 
the  Pacific  coast,  called  ""  balsas.""  It  is  a  strong- 
sort  of  raft,  lashed  securely  together,  and  carries  a 
sail  when  required.  Au  reste  these  balsas  answer 
the  purpose  of  house,  carriage,  a  kitchen,  parlour,  and 
all.""  We  were  a  good  deal  amused,  while  awaiting  the 
time  of  our  departure,  in  watching  their  manoeuvres. 
Several  came  round  us,  the  occupiers  trying  to  dispose 
of  their  various  wares,  which  included  ponchos,  straw 
hats,  monkeys,  parrots,  grass  hammocks,  fruit,  and 
flowers.  I  have  been  watching  the  concoction  of  a 
shocking  dose  which  the  doctor  is  preparing  for  our 
benefit  in  crossing  the  isthmus,  which  is  at  present 
much  infected  with  ""the  fever""  so  called,  and  which,  if 
it  once  gets  hold  of  you,  they  say  it  is  rarely,  if  ever, 
to  be  shaken  off.  Dr.  T.'s  nostrum  is  a  bottle  of  sherry, 
in  which  he  has  infused  such  a  quantity  of  quinine, 
that  it  will  demand  a  great  deal  of  courage,  both 
moral  and  physical,  to  take  his  prescribed  quantity, 
which  is  a  wine  glassful  every  five  miles.  This  is 
the  native  country  of  quinine,  consequently  it  is  procured here  in  alJ  its  strength  and  freshness.  We 
have  just  heard  that,  to  crown  our  good  fortune,  we 
beat  the  great  mail  steamer  Sant  Jago  by  three  hours, 
though  she  had  twelve  hours  start  of  us. 

6th. —  Landed  this  morning,  and  to  our  great 
regret,  were  obliged  to  say  good-bye  to  Captain  Marshall almost  immediately,  as  he  found  it  necessary 
to  proceed  to  Darien  (San  Miguel)  in  the  afternoon, 
to  render  assistance  if  need  be,  to  the  exploring 
party,  from  whom  the  last  intelligence  is  very  unsatisfactory. The  Indians  are  evidently  determined 
to  resist  to  the  death  any  attempt  to  penetrate  into 
their  territories.  They  have  already  resorted  to  the 
old  savage  expedient  of  shooting  poisoned  arrows 
from  ambuscade.  Having  taken  leave  of  Captain  M. 
and  the  Virago's  officers,  we  proceeded  to  Mr.  Hurtado's,  where  we  found  a  little  daughter  had  been 
born  since  our  last  visit.  We  were  also  equally 
surprised  to  find  Captain  Parker  awaiting  us,  he 
having  crossed  the  isthmus  in  order  to  escort  us 
back.  I  will  now  conclude  this  letter,  having  ended 
our  pleasant  Peruvian  journey,  and  safely  passed  all 
perils  in  the  Pacific.  We  must  hope  for  equally 
good  luck,  during  the  remainder  of  our  travel  on  the 
Atlantic.  Your  ever  affectionate, 

C. "
44,"Off  Navy  Bay,  on  board  the  Dee,  March  1th.  —  My 
dear  Father,  —  This  morning  early  we  took  our  last 
look  at  the  beautiful  Bay  of  Panama,  which  appeared 
lovelier  than  ever  in  the  beams  of  the  rising  sun. 
Our  ride  this  time  was,  if  possible,  even  hotter  than 
when  we  traversed  the  same  ground  a  month  ago ; 
but  the  beauty  of  the  forest  scenery  and  luxuriance 
of  vegetation  is  still  the  same,  and  yet  still  new.  The 
railway  being  now  completed  as  far  as  a  little  Indian 
village  called  Rio  Obispo,  we  Were,  by  rather  hastening 
our  mules  and  considerably  heating  ourselves,  enabled 
to  perform  the  passage  across  in  one  day.  We  arrived 
at  Ri6  at  half-past  one  P.M.,  having  had  a  quick 
broiling  ride  from  Panama.  I  was  partly  amused 
and  partly  shocked  at  the  necessity  of  letting  my 
Guayaquil  parrot  be  carried  on  the  back  of  a  negro 
all  this  distance.  The  ground  was  absolutely  scorching to  the  touch,  yet  the  black  bearer  had  bare  feet. 
He  however  did  not  seem  to  mind  this,  and  trudged 
on  apparently  contented.  Not  so  poor  ""Lorita."" 
I  am  sorry  to  say  she  completely  lost  her  temper  and 
every  time  her  carrier  hitched  her  cage  up  or  down, 
or  otherwise  deranged  her  equilibrium,  she  began  to 
swear  most  lustily  all  the  bad  words  her  Spanish 
educational  repertoire  could  furnish  her.     Luckily 
there  will  be  few  in  England  likely  to  understand  her 
if    she   should    commit   any   similar   misdemeanors 
there,  as  besides  her  bad  language  being  Spanish,  it 
is  provincial,  and  has  a  great  deal  of  dialect  incomprehensible to  the  world  in  general.     We  left  Bio  by 
the  train,  and  in  three  hours  more  we  were  once 
again  on  board  the  Dee,  where  it  was  really  pleasant 
to  find  ourselves  so  heartily  welcomed,  and  to  see  the 
happy  faces  of  the  white  people,  and  the  grinning  ones 
of  the  blacks,  as  they  all  came  crowding  round  us  on 
our  arrival. 

8th. — Early  this  morning  the  ""  Bonnie  Dee  ""  took 
a  run  down  to  Chagres,  a  little  bit  of  extra  travel  for 
which  I  am  by  no  means  sorry,  as  it  affords  me  an 
opportunity  of  seeing  a  place  now  but  rarely  visited. 
Chagres  was  formerly  the  starting-point  for  the  people 
bound  across  the  isthmus ;  they  here  embarked  in  the 
little  canoes  and  generally  spent  three  or  four  days 
tedious  poling  up  the  river.  Now  of  course  the 
Navy  Bay  railroad  has  usurped  all  other  modes  of 
transit.  I  have  seldom,  however,  been  more  pleased 
with  the  appearance  of  a  place  than  I  was  with  this, 
partly  I  suppose  from  the  surprise.  I  had  generally
 figured  Chagres  to  myself  as  a  parched,  sandy,  unhealthy, and  perfectly  flat  part  of  the  world ;  instead 
of  which  I  found  something  as  nearly  as  possible  the 
exact  reverse  of  all  this.     We  landed  from  a  beautiful little  bay,  quite  land  locked;  and  so  calm  and 
still  was  everything  around  that  we  could  almost  have 
fancied  ourselves  the  first  discoverers  of  the  soil.     A 
short  walk  however  brought  us  to  the  town,  so  called, 
of  Chagres.     This  consists  merely  of  a  few  Indian 
huts,  the  few  establishments  that  once  existed  for  the 
temporary  accommodation  of  travellers  being  now 
either  closed  or  entirely  demolished,  and  the  rest  have 
returned   to   their   primitive   simplicity.     We   next 
ascended  the  heights  and  visited  the  remains  of  the 
old  castle  of  Chagres,  once  a  great  stronghold  of  the 
Spaniards,  but  now  left  to  the  mercies  of  weather 
and  time ;  a  sad  pity.   There  are  some  splendid  guns, 
most  elaborately  carved  and  ornamented,  but  all  deserted and  left  to  their  fate  ;  also  a  cellar  containing 
no  end  of  barrels  of  gunpowder,  but  all  so  damp  that 
a  bonfire  would  fail  to  ignite  them.     The  view  from 
every  side  was  most  beautiful,  and  we  left  it  much 
regretting   that   time   allowed   us   so  short  a  visit. 
Before   re-embarking  we  were  shown   another  and 
different  scene,  but  a  most  lovely  one,  a  green  valley 
and  a  forest  walk,  with  a  clear  bright  stream  rushing 
at  our  feet,  and,  above  all,  the  warm  blue  sky  and  that 
indescribable  stillness  in  the  air  so  peculiar  to  these 
tropical  climes,  So  farewell  to  Chagres.  And  now 
we  are  once  more  upon  the  waters.  We  returned  to 
Navy  Bay  to  take  up  the  mails,  and  then  finally  took 
our  departure. 

9th  and  Wth. — We  have  experienced  a  most  violent 
gale  of  wind  during  these  two  days ;  moreover,  it  has 
been  all  the  wrong  way,  or  what  sailors  call  right 
ahead.  We  were  much  rejoiced,  therefore,  to  find  ourselves this  morning,  the  llth,  in  the  long  creek,  and 
consequently  smooth  water,  leading  to  Cartagena,  at 
which  place  we  landed  about  eleven  o'clock.  Mr. 
Kortright,  remembering  that  we  had  not  been  able 
to  see  anything  of  the  place  on  our  former  visit,  had 
very  kindly  sent  his  carriage  to  meet  us,  and  although 
our  time  was  still  very  limited,  we  had  a  very  agreeable drive  all  about  the  environs  of  the  city.  We 
went  to  the  fort  of  the  Popa,  and  thus  had  an  opportunity of  examining  it  and  its  strange  shape  more 
nearly.  The  building  which  crowns  its  summit  is  a 
convent.  We  stopped  often,  to  gather  some  of  the 
beautiful  flowers  which  grow  in  wild  profusion  all 
around.  The  town  is  handsome,  and  besides  reminding me,  as  I  before  mentioned,  of  Venice  in  the 
distance,  the  narrow  streets  and  overhanging  roofs  of 
the  houses  on  a  nearer  view  recalled  Genoa  to  my 
recollection.  About  an  hour  ago  we  returned  and 
partook  of  luncheon  with  our  hospitable  host.  I  am 
writing  this  from  his  house,  so  that  it  will  bear  the 
Cartagena  post-mark.  The  time  is  drawing  near  now 
for  going  on  board  the  Dee  again,  and  to-night  we 
shall  take  our  last  look  at  South  America. 

Ever  your  affectionate, 

C. "
45,"On  board  the  Conway,  off  Porto  Rico,  March 
18th. — My  dear  Father, —  Since  the  date  of  my  last 
letter  until  yesterday,  we  have  had  a  regular  succession of  gales,  almost  amounting'  to  hurricane ;  the 
first  really  bad  weather  (for  any  length  of  time  consecutively) that  we  have  suffered  since  our  arrival 
in  the  land  of  the  West.  We  reached  St.  Thomas 
yesterday  morning  at  eight  o'clock.  All  things  much 
the  same  there.  Having  transferred  ourselves  and 
our  effects  from  the  Dee  to  this  vessel,  we  had  about 
the  time  to  make  ourselves  comfortable  before  sailing. We  are  now  bound  on  our  last  island  trip, 
Jamaica  being  our  present  destination.  Early  this 
morning  we  anchored  in  the  harbour  of  Porto  Rico, 
or  I  should  more  correctly  say,  St.  Juan  de  Porto 
Rico,  that  being  the  name  of  the  seaport.  But  a 
great  disappointment  has  awaited  us  here.  We  are 
not  allowed  to  land,  vessels  coming  from  St. 
Thomas  being  in  quarantine,  although  the  cholera 
has  disappeared  from  there  now.  They  think  it 
better  to  be   on  the  safe  side.     We   are  therefore 
obliged  to  rest  contented  with  what  we  can  see  from 
the  ship  of  the  town   and   harbour,  which   bear  a 
most   striking  resemblance  to   Havana,   only  on   a 
smaller  scale.     It  was  very  pleasant  at  all  events  to 
see  the  dear  old  Spanish  flag  again  waving  over  the 
walls,  though  I  fear  this  will  be  the  last  occasion  on 
which  we  shall  meet  with  it  in  this  part  of  the  world. 
We  shall   leave  here  at   sunset;   I   shall  therefore 
resume  my  letter  at  our  next  halting-place,  which 
will  I  believe  be  Hayti.     Meanwhile  it  is  no  slight 
comfort  to  have  calm  weather  after  the  storms  of 
the  past  week.     ...          .          ... 

19th. — We  arrived  in  the  Bay  of  Jacmel  this 
morning,  and  landed  immediately,  as  we  were 
allowed  a  short  time  to  stay.  The  island  is  now 
more  generally  called  St.  Domingo,  than  by  its 
original  name  of  Hayti.  Whence  this  has  arisen  I 
know  not,  as  St.  Domingo  was  a  town  so  called  by 
Christopher  Columbus,  the  island  having  been  first 
discovered  by  him  on  Sunday;  but  up  to  very 
recently  it  has  been  called  indifferently  Hispaniola 
or  Hayti.  The  appearance  of  Jacmel  from  a  distance is  more  prepossessing  then  it  proves  to  be  on 
a  closer  inspection.  Of  course  I  speak  only  of  the 
town,  which  seen  from  the  sea  looks  Babylonian ;  that 
is,  laid  out  in  terraces  and  hanging  gardens,  but  turns 
out  really  nothing  of  the  sort,  merely  the  accidental 
grouping  of  some  trees  within  the  walls.  The 
scenery  around  is,  however,  beautiful,  as  only  the 
Antilles  are.  The  French  claim  for  Hayti,  the  same 
appellation  as  the  Spanish  do  for  Cuba,  ""  La  Eeine 
des  Antilles.""  Being  here  so  short  a  time,  and  able 
only  to  take  a  very  superficial  view  of  it,  I  am  of 
course  unable  to  determine  how  far  this  may  be 
merited.  Still  I  cannot  imagine  it  can  equal  Cuba, 
at  least  with  its  present  semi-savage  rulers.  What 
it  might  be  in  Spanish  hands,  to  whom  it  certainly 
legitimately  belongs,  is  another  question.  The  Emperor Soulouque,  the  Duke  of  Marmalade,  and  the 
rest  of  his  sugary  suite  are  at  Port-au-Prince,  so  we 
were  not  gratified  with  a  sight  of  them.  . 

Kingston,  Jamaica,  March  22nd.  —  We  landed 
here  this  morning  only,  though  we  arrived  last 
evening,  but  too  late  to  enter  Port  Eoyal  harbour, 
which  requires  daylight,  or  at  least  bright  moonlight. 
This  is  a  pity,  as  I  hear  the  view  is  fine  approaching 
Port  Eoyal  from  the  south.  We  are  not  going  to 
wait  to  see  any  sights  here  (if  any  exist)  at  present, 
but  have  engaged  a  carriage  to  take  us  to  Spanish 
Town,  about  twelve  miles  off;  whence  I  shall  despatch this  letter.  .  .  3  P.M.  we  have  just  arrived 
here;  had  a  very  pleasant  drive.  There  is  a  railroad 
for  the  benefit  of  people  in  a  hurry,  but  as  we  wished 
to  see  a  little  of  the  country,  we  preferred  the  slower 
mode  of  progress.  Our  friends  are  staying  in  the 
country,  enjoying  the  mountain  air  ;  but,  fortunately 
Sir  Joshua  Kowe  had  come  into  town  this  morning, 
and  so  received  us.  We  are  to  accompany  him  to- 
morrow to  The  Cedars,  his  mountain  residence. 
Adieu  now.  This  letter  will  go  back  by  the  return 
steamer.  Ever  your  affectionate,

46,"The  Cedars,  March  29th.  —  My  dear  Father,  - 
We  have  passed  a  very  pleasant  week  among  the 
hills  ;  the  scenery  of  Jamaica  is  certainly  very  beautiful, and  I  think  grows  upon  one  every  day;  at 
least  I  find  it  prettier  and  finer  now  than  I  did  the 
first  day.  The  verdure  is  perfectly  wonderful,  and 
the  view  from  the  lawn  of  The  Cedars,  of  hill  and 
valley  all  thickly  covered  with  trees  of  every  kind 
and  every  variety  of  tint,  with  Port  Royal  in  the 
distance,  and  the  sea  bounding  the  horizon,  form 
a  landscape  one  could  scarcely  ever  tire  of  gazing 
at.  I  think  my  chief  admiration  here  in  the  way 
of  trees  and  plants  are  the  orange  and  lemon  trees ; 
they  are  quite  lovely.  They  grow  to  a  great  height 
and  in  every  direction,  and  with  their  profusion 
of  golden  fruit,  snowy  flowers,  and  dark  glossy  leaves, 
all  in  full  bloom  at  the  same  time,  make  the  orange, 
in  my  opinion,  the  queen  of  plants.  There  is  a 
pretty  place  called  Keith  Hall  a  short  distance  from 
The  Cedars ;  but  higher  up  the  hill  side  they  command 
a  more  extensive  view,  and  one  particularly  beautiful, of  a  chain  of  hills,  and  one  especially  called 
Monte  Diablo.  I  also  observed  some  very  fine 
specimens  of  bamboo  trees ;  they  are  so  very  graceful 
and  fairy-like.  There  is  a  cluster  of  them  on  Sir 
Joshua  Howe's  property  that  look  exactly  like  a 
gigantic  bunch  of  Prince  of  Wales'  feathers. 

31st. — We  returned  to  town  yesterday.  To-day  we 
paid  a  visit  to  Lady  Barkly  at  Government  House &  
then  went  over  the  courts  of  justice  and  the  House 
of  Assembly:  nothing  very  remarkable  in  either. 
Matters  seem  in  a  very  bad  way  in  the  house, 
and  the  Governor  has  a  difficult  and  thankless  part 
to  play.  Quarrels  ""never  ending,  still  beginning,"" 
seem  to  be  the  only  order  of  the  day  attended  to 
vigorously  in  the  Jamaican  parliament.  We  went 
afterwards  to  the  cathedral,  where  the  principal 
object  of  attraction  is  the  beautiful  marble  monument (by  Baily)  to  Lady  Elgin,  who  died  in  her 
youth  and  beauty  here  during  Lord  E.'s  governorship of  the  'island.  The  House  of  Assembly  voted 
a  sum  of  £-300  for  the  sculpture,  and  the  artist  has 
been  very  successful,  both  in  the  resemblance  of 
the  statue  to  the  original,  and  in  the  general  design 
and  execution  of  the  whole. 

April  4th. —  Rode  some  days  ago  to  a  most  romantic spot,  though  bearing  a  very  uncouth  name, 
""  the  Bog  Walk : ""  without  any  exception,  the  loveliest  and  yet  the  strangest   bit  of  forest  scenery  I 
have   met  with  in  my  wanderings.     The  principal 
features  in  the  landscape  are  the  bamboo  trees,  and 
on  entering  the  particular  glade  called  the  (f  bog,"" 
a  most  wondrous  spectacle  is  presented  to  the  view ; 
the  graceful  branches  of  the  bamboos,  of  which  I 
have  before  spoken,  by  some  curious  fantaisie  of 
nature,   have   entwined    themselves   and  interlaced 
each  other  over  your  head.     The  effect  is  a  perfect 
gothic  arch,  and  as  it  is  repeated  and  continuous 
for  a  very  considerable  distance,   one  might  fancy 
oneself  in  the  ""  long  drawn  aisle  and  fretted  vault "" 
of  some  old  cathedral.     In  the  middle  of  this  aisle 
or  avenue  rushes  a  clear,  bright,  noisy  stream,  dashing 
turbulently  against  stones,  rocks,  and  other  obstacles 
that  come  in  its  way.      Between  this  stream  and 
the  stems  of  the  beautiful  arches  there  is  just  room 
for  a  horse  and  his  rider   to   pass.     The  name  of 
""  the  Bog  Walk  ""  is,  I  hear,  an  English  corruption 
of  ""La  Boca,""  or  some  say,  ""La  Boca  de  Aqua,"" 
meaning   the   mouth   or   river's   mouth ;   the   little 
stream  I  have  mentioned  being  near  the  mouth  of 
one  of  Jamaica's  many  rivers.      The  island  is  greatly 
famed   for   the   number   and   variety  of  its  woods. 
Many  were  pointed  out  in  our  ride  to  day,  mahogany, 
satin  wood,  ebony,  lignum  vitae,  &c. 

5th. — Left  Sir  J.  and  Lady  Rowe  for  an  excursion 
of  a  few  days  in  the  mountains.    Drove  from  Spanish 
Town  to  the  terminus,  and  thence  by  the  railway 
to  Kingston.  We  had  here  a  fine  view  of  all  the 
shipping  in  this  harbour,  as  well  as  in  Port  Royal. 
In  the  latter  is  the  quarantine  ground ;  we  noticed 
a  good  number  of  victimised  ships  bearing  the  unlucky yellow  flag.  It  is  peculiarly  unfortunate  to 
be  detained  here  in  quarantine,  as  Port  Royal  and 
Kingston  are  considered  the  most,  if  not  the  only, 
unhealthy  parts  of  the  island. 

Hence  we  started  for  Newcastle,  a  distance  of 
fourteen  miles,  passing  through  ""  Up  Park  Camp  "" 
on  our  way.  This  is  a  military  station  containing 
a  force  varying  from  300  to  500  men,  according 
to  circumstances.  During  times  of  cholera,  fever, 
or  any  other  trouble,  Up  Park  is  considered  generally 
to  possess  purer  and  healthier  air  than  any  on  the 
coast.  About  eleven  miles  from  Kingston  we  arrived 
at  a  place  called  the  Botanical  Garden.  Once  upon 
a  time  a  garden  did  really  exist ;  now  there  is  but 
the  name.  It  is  the  limit  to  which  ordinary  shaped 
carriages  have  access ;  beyond  it  either  two  wheeled 
vehicles,  such  as  volantes,  or  gigs,  or  very  narrow 
carts,  are  the  only  means  of  passage  by  draught. 
We  rode  on  horseback,  my  old  friend  Col.  Luxmoore 
(who  by  a  curious  coincidence  commands  the  detachment of  the  16th  Regiment  now  at  Newcastle) 
having  sent  saddle  horses  for  our  use.  We  had  a 
pleasant  and  very  picturesque  ride  during  the  remainder  of  the  distance,  and  arrived  at  Col.  L.'s 
quarters  just  as  the  day  was  fading;  found  Mrs. 
Luxmoore  and  my  friend  Cissy  (her  daughter)  waiting 
to  welcome  me.  An  hour  after  this  we  sat  down 
to  a  merry  dinner,  consisting  chiefly  of  former  friends 
and  acquaintances.  The  last  time  we  met  having 
been  in  Greece,  we  little  anticipated  the  change  of 
scene  four  years  would  produce. 

8th. — This  is  the  funniest  little  nook  in  the  world ; 
there  is  scarcely  an  inch  of  level  ground  to  be  discovered far  or  near.  The  houses  or  cottages  used 
by  the  officers  as  quarters  are  scattered  about  in  every 
direction,  above  and  below,  some  of  them  perched  so 
high  as  to  be  very  difficult  of  access.  The  garden 
belonging  to  this  cottage  of  Col.  L.'s  where  we  are  is 
some  forty  feet  above  us ;  all  the  dwelling-places 
have  this  nest-like  appearance.  In  this  garden, 
which  when  arrived  at  is  remarkably  pretty,  grows 
a  natural  curiosity,  in  the  existence  of  which  I  certainly should  not  have  believed  had  I  not  actually 
seen  it;  namely,  a  green  rose.  There  were  three 
blossoming  on  the  bush,  besides  several  buds.  The 
flowers  were  in  all  respects  like  the  ordinary  pink, 
red,  or  white  rose,  the  same  soft  velvety  leaves,  only 
of  a  pale  green  colour ;  in  all  other  particulars  the 
plant  was  just  like  any  other,  the  stalks,  thorns,  green 
leaves,  &c.  I  was  allowed  to  gather  one  of  the 
three  blossoms  I  had  seen  in  flower,  and  have  placed 
it  between  the  leaves  of  this  book ;  not  that  I  shall 
expect  any  one  who  may  see  it  hereafter  in  its  faded 
hue  to  believe  in  its  original  one,  unless  they  too 
should  have  visited  Newcastle  and  Col.  Luxmoore's 
garden.  I  shall  close  this  letter  now,  or  it  will  be 

too  voluminous. 

Ever  your  affectionate,

47,"Newcastle,  Jamaica,  April  10th. — My  dear  Father, 
-—We  made  an  excursion  on  horseback  the  day 
before  yesterday  to  the  St.  Katharine  hills.  They 
are  off-shoots  from  the  Blue  Mountain  chain.  One 
might  well  fancy  oneself  in  Scotland,  or,  I  should 
perhaps  rather  say,  in  Wales.  The  keen  cold  air  (we 
are  about  4000  feet  above  the  sea),  the  smooth  green 
grass  covered  hills,  bear  a  great  resemblance  to  the 
scenery  of  some  of  our  excursions  among  the  Welsh 
mountains  and  valleys.  This,  however,  though  very 
healthy  and  beneficial  to  the  troops  after  being  baked 
in  Kingston,  is  the  least  pleasant  and  least  pretty  expedition I  have  yet  made.  It  is  too  bleak  and  too 
poor  looking  to  be  appreciated  after  the  warmth  and 
the  luxuriant  vegetation  we  have  so  lately  left.  Next 
day  we  made  a  far  more  agreeable  excursion  to  Charlottenberg,  the  country  residence  of  the  Bishop  of 
Jamaica.  I  have  rarely  been  so  strongly  tempted  to 
break  the  tenth  commandment  as  I  was  on  entering 
this  delightful  abode  ;  that  it  belongs  to  a  Bishop,  too, 
makes  the  enormity  of  my  coveting  worse  still.  I 
thoroughly  realised  on  this  spot  the  poet's  apostrophe to  a  yet  very  different  scene. 

""  A  blending  of  all  beauties  ;  streams  and  dells, 
Fruit,  foliage,  crag,  wood,  mountain,  cornfield  "" — 

the  last  word  must  here  be  omitted  as  the  ""  vine  ""  is 
not  one  of  the  blended  beauties  in  this  fair  scene. 
Grapes  do  exist  nevertheless  in  Jamaica,  and  are  excellent-flavoured ;  but  the  vine  is  not  a  distinctive 
feature  or  characteristic  of  the  country.  It  would 
be  difficult  to  single  out  any  one  particular  class  of 
tree  or  plant  in  the  rich  and  varied  tract  of  country, 
spread  before  us  to-day,  as  an  especial  object  of  admiration. When  you  have  mangoes,  cocoa-nuts, 
allspice  (pimento),  olives,  tamarinds,  banana,  oranges, 
pomegranates,  sugar,  and  coffee,  all  growing  in  luxuriant profusion  around,  you  are  too  much  dazzled 
with  the  whole  to  be  able  to  specify  what  is  the  most 
beautiful.  At  least  I  found  it  so.  Then  besides  the 
wonderful  scene  of  fertility  I  have  been  trying  to 
describe,  the  magnificence  of  the  view  can  scarcely 
be  imagined  from  the  terrace  of  Charlottenberg, 
backed  by  the  noble  range  of  the  Blue  Mountains, 
and  bounded  at  the  horizon  by  the  azure  coloured 
sea.  The  house  is  in  perfect  keeping  with  the 
gardens  and  other  external  belongings  of  the  Bishop. 
The  rooms  are  spacious  and  cool.  The  floors  beautifully  inlaid  with  specimens  of  the  various  woods 
grown  in  Jamaica;  tables,  chairs,  and  other  furniture of  carved  ebony.  Having  visited  the  principal 
rooms,  we  proceeded  to  a  little  summer  house,  where 
we  took  some  refreshment,  and  gazed  once  more  at 
the  enchanting  view  beneath  us,  through  the  medium 
of  stained  glass  of  different  colours,  which  is  let  in  here 
and  there  in  the  windows.  To-morrow  we  are  to  set  out 
on  the  last  expedition  of  any  consequence  we  shall 
make  in  this  part  of  the  world  ;  namely,  we  purpose 
making  the  ascent  of  the  Blue  Mountain  Peak.  The 
difficulties  are  great,  I  hear,  and  some  of  our  friends 
think  the  undertaking  very  hazardous.  On  the  other 
hand,  I  am  told  that  with  good  courage  and  good 
will  to  persevere,  we  can  do  it;  and  that,  moreover, Lord  Metcalfe  went  up  when  he  was  an  old 
man,  and  suffering  from  the  gout ;  so  under  these 
circumstances  I  think  there  can  be  scarcely  any  unconquerable difficulties  for  us.  The  actual  height  is 
nothing'particular,  merely  8000  feet,  yet  I  understand 
the  chief  actual  inconvenience  one  suffers  is  from  the 
excessive  rarity  of  the  air,  and  the  consequent 
difficulty  of  breathing.  I  shall  be  glad,  however,  if 
we  should  be  ultimately  successful,  and  reach  the  top 
without  any  hindrance,  as  among  other  objects  to  be 
attained,  is  a  sight  of  dear  old  Cuba,  which  will 
much  rejoice  me  to  behold  once  more,  before  taking 
my  departure  from  the  west. 
llth. — We  left  Newcastle  on  horseback  about  10 
o'clock  A.M.  Our  destination  this  evening  being  the 
house  of  a  Mr.  Pownall,  who  resides  at  the  foot  of 
the  mountain,  having  come  here  many  years  ago,  and 
lived  at  his  present  abode  ever  since.  From  his 
house  I  am  now  writing  this.  We  passed  over  a 
considerable  part  of  the  country  to-day,  which  we 
saw  yesterday  from  Charlottenberg.  Found  a  close 
examination  as  beautiful  in  its  way  as  the  more  distant one.  The  coffee  plantations  especially  gain  on 
a  near  approach ;  the  perfume  is  delicious,  and  the 
plant,  whether  in  the  flower  or  berry,  is  graceful  and 
pretty.  An  extensive  estate,  part  of  which  we  traversed, was  pointed  out  to  me  as  having  formed  a 
portion  of  the  Duke  of  Buckingham's  property  in 
this  island.  We  reached  Mr.  P.'s  ""hermitage"" 
about  3  o'clock,  and  were  welcomed  by  him  with 
much  civility.  It  is  a  curious  fancy  that  has  led 
this  gentleman  here.  I  understand  he  was  formerly 
a  farmer,  and  lived  in  Essex  (rather  a  contrast  to  the 
Blue  Mountain).  Some  accidental  circumstance 
having  caused  him  to  pay  a  visit  to  Jamaica,  here  he 
has  remained  ever  since,  and  has  farmed  his  little  tropical estate  very  successfully.  He  calls  himself 
""  the  old  man  of  the  mountain,""  of  which  for  many 
years  past  he  has  done  the  honours  to  all  comers. 
We  sat  down  to  dinner  shortly  after  our  arrival,  a 
plentiful  repast  in  the  English  style.  A  ""  distinguished  dish,""  to  my  great  amusement,  being  broad 
beans  and  bacon.  Our  host  thinks  we  may  safely  try 
the  experiment  to-morrow  morning,  and  he  proposes 
to  accompany  us  as  well  as  our  present  party,  and 
the  regular  guides.  It  seems  the  grand  difficulty  to 
be  conquered,  is  a  place  commonly  called  ""Jacob's 
Ladder,""  which  people  ascend  as  they  can,  there 
being  no  steps  and  no  path,  and  only  at  rare  intervals any  terra  firma  on  which  to  plant  the  feet.  This 
does  not  sound  pleasant ;  but  we  shall  see  what  tomorrow will  bring.  Our  meal  being  ended,  we 
strolled  out  to  look  at  the  coffee  garden  attached  to 
the  house.  The  trees  are  now  in  full  bloom,  of  a 
pale  pink  colour.  The  odour  is  most  agreeable,  very 
aromatic.  This  is  a  very  small  plantation,  Mr.  P. 
farming  it  for  his  own  private  use,  as  I  suppose  he 
would  turnips  in  his  native  Essex.  What  a  difference ! 

12th. —  Well,  the  Peak  is  a  fait  accompli,  and  we 
are  alive  to  tell  the  tale ;  but  it  is  an  undertaking  I 
should  be  very  sorry  to  attempt  again,  and  one  I 
should  not  have  pursued  now  to  the  end,  had  it  been 
practicable  to  return ;  but  this  was  impossible.  I  will 
presently  say  why.  Bttftooft  Librwy 

We  started  betimes  in  the  morning,  a  party  of 
five  besides  the  guides.  For  about  two  miles  and  a 
half  we  rode  on  ponies ;  and  this,  though  comparatively easy  work  to  the -rest  of  the  journey,  was  in 
itself  rather  dangerous ;  at  least  we  ran  the  risk  of 
our  faces  and  features  being  disfigured  several  times. 
A  kind  of  track,  it  can  scarcely  be  termed  a  path  or 
road,  has  been  cut  through  the  dense  tangled  masses 
of  vegetation  with  which  the  sides  of  the  mountain 
are  clothed ;  but  as  the  visits  of  strangers  to  the 
Peak  are  few  and  far  between,  the  prolific  soil  allows 
of  considerable  growth  of  branches,  leaves,  and 
parasite  creepers  of  all  descriptions  in  the  intervals 
between  the  times  of  cutting  the  track.  To  day,  as 
we  were  all  obliged  to  advance  in  single  file,  and  our 
ponies  were  chiefly  anxious  to  follow  each  other 
without  troubling  themselves  about  their  riders,  we 
were  repeatedly  caught,  sometimes  across  the  eyes, 
sometimes  across  the  mouth,  and  last  and  worst, 
under  the  chin,  narrowly  escaping  strangulation,  by 
the  boughs  and  tendrils  of  the  trees  and  their  parasites, interlacing  each  other  across  our  path.  For 
my  own  part  I  speedily  found  my  only  chance  of 
safety  lay  in  leaving  my  pony  to  his  own  devices, 
and  providing  for  myself  as  well  as  I  could.  So, 
quickly  twisting  my  bridle  round  the  pommel,  I  laid 
myself  as  flat  down  as  I  could,  on  the  neck  of  my 
gallant  steed,  and  extended  my  legs  towards  his  tail ; 
and  in  this  interesting  Mazeppa-like  attitude  (which 
would  have  made  my  fortune  at  Astley's)  was  accomplished the  remainder  of  the  equestrian  portion 
of  our  course.  We  now  had  to  proceed  on  foot,  and 
for  about  a  mile  or  so  we  found  the  ascent  no  very 
formidable  task  —  stumbling  over  the  stumps  of  old 
trees,  and  entangling  oneself  in  briars,  being  the 
worst  catastrophes  to  speak  of.  Soon,  however,  occurred a  change,  of  which  the  first  symptom  was 
want  of  breath,  and  a  necessity  of  stopping  every 
few  steps,  to  try  and  recover  it.  The  cold,  too,  now 
became  intense.  Just  before  reaching  the  terrible 
Jacob's  Ladder,  at  a  sudden  turn  of  the  path,  a 
splendid  view  burst  upon  our  sight,  and  with  which 
I  heartily  wish  we  had  contented  ourselves,  and 
advanced  no  further.  From  the  pinnacle  on  which 
we  were  perched,  we  seemed  to  look  straight  down 
several  thousand  feet,  and  where  the  orange  trees 
apparently  dipped  their  branches  into  the  clear  bright 
waves  beneath.  This,  however,  was  an  optical  delu- 
sion—  the  projection  of  the  land  giving  the  branches 
the  appearance  of  touching  the  water,  though  in 
reality  some  hundred  feet  above  it.  Finally,  at  the 
edge  of  the  horizon  could  be  just  faintly  traced  the 
outline  of  the  Cuban  coast,  and  the  highland  near 
Sant  Jago  de  Cuba.  I  understand  now  whence  the 
name  of  Jacob's  Ladder  is  derived.  This  is  to  all 
intents  and  purposes  a  road  through  the  air,  the 
mode  of  progress  being  catching  hold  of  branches  of 
trees,  and  by  their  means  swinging  or  hoisting  yourself up,  till  you  find  a  resting  place,  or  perch  for  the 
sole  of  your  foot,  on  some  bough  or  stump,  and  so 
on  ad  infinitum.  For  a  few  yards  we  got  on  tolerably, though  the  fatigue  was  something  beyond  conception, for  it  is  scarcely  ever  possible  to  be  helped 
by  any  other  person,  as  each  one  is  generally  on  a 
different  level.  I  would  have  gladly  now  abandoned 
the  project,  but  to  retrace  one's  steps  on  Jacob's 
Ladder,  is  an  impossibility.  One  may  get  up,  one 
cannot  get  down  these  aerial  steps.  Exhaustion,  cold, 
and  the  painful  gasping  for  breath,  from  which  we 
were  now  suffering,  made  it  very  problematical 
whether  we  could  move  another  step.  Brandy  and 
milk  (a  curious  concoction)  was  now  administered, 
at  least  so  it  was  said  to  be ;  but  I  was  past  all  power 
of  tasting,  or  even  of  knowing  any  thing  crossed  my 
lips.  I  can  only  suppose  the  instinct  of  self-preservation impelled  us  onwards,  as  we  did  eventually 
reach  the  summit.  Here  I  must  have  lost  all  consciousness, for  on  coming  to  myself,  I  found  I  was 
seated  on  the  ground,  in  a  little  log  hut,  before  a 
blazing  fire ;  two  people  chafing  my  hands,  which 
were  turned  almost  slate  colour,  and  a  third  trying 
to  insinuate  a  glass  of  wine  between  my  lips,  which 
they  informed  me  were  of  the  same  beautiful  hue. 
E.  told  me  she  had  been  in  much  the  same  plight, 
but  had  recovered  more  quickly.  The  shelter  from 
the  keen  air,  and  the  cheerful  warmth  of  the  fire, 
gradually  restored  us  to  our  natural  feelings  and  complexions, and  then  we  were  not  long  in  discovering 
that  we  were  in  a  state  bordering  on  starvation  ;  so 
we  very  soon  set  to,  with  right  good  will,  to  demolish 
the  excellent  luncheon  our  host  had  provided.  We 
then  proceeded  to  look  at  the  prospect  we  had  incurred such  hardships  in  trying  to  see.  I  was  not  a 
little  provoked  at  finding  it  in  nearly  all  respects  the 
same  as  we  had  enjoyed  at  the  foot  of  Jacob's  Ladder. 
Soon  after  this  we  commenced  the  descent,  but  not 
by  the  same  route.  I -should  have  thought  we  might 
have  gone  up  by  the  road  we  came  down,  but  they 
tell  me  it  would  have  been  impossible,  so  I  take  it 
upon  trust,  as  I  certainly  shall  not  make  the  experiment. We  reached  the  hermitage  safely,  though 
terribly  tired. 

13th. —  Much  refreshed  from  a  good  long  night's 
rest.  Said  good-bye  to  the  hermit,  and  rode  back  to 
Newcastle,  where  we  found  our  friends  much  astonished to  hear  we  had  actually  accomplished  the 
ascent,  they  having  believed  we  should  take  alarm  at 
the  last  moment. 

20th,  St.  Thomas.  —  We  sail  for  England  at  midnight. Since  writing  the  foregoing  last  pages  we 
returned  to  Spanish  Town  and  were  enabled  to  spend 
two  pleasant  days  with  Sir  J.  and  Lady  Rowe,  whom 
we  left  with  much  regret.  This  is  the  fifth  visit  we 
have  paid  to  St.  Thomas  since  we  left  home.  Still, 
in  my  opinion,  it  is  as  pretty  and  as  green  as  ever.
I  shall  always  keep  a  kindly  remembrance  of  it,  and 
think  of  it  as  of  an  old  friend.  Our  long  and  varied 
journey  is  now  drawing  to  its  close.  Between  this 
and  England  it  is  scarcely  probable  anything  worth 
chronicling  will  arise.  We  have  bid  farewell  to  the 
many  friends  and  companions  of  our  voyages,  a  sorrowful enough  task,  only  brightened  by  anticipations 
of  the  future,  and,  on  my  side,  of  seeing  you  and 

home  again. 

Till  then  adieu,

New  York  (Astor  House),  September  16th. —  My 
dear  Father, — Behold  us  here  still,  in  spite  of  all  our 
anticipatipns  to  the  contrary.  A  most  untoward  accident has  occurred.  We  proceeded,  according  to  arrangement, on  the  morning  of  the  13th,  to  the  quay  of 
embarkation,  having  taken  our  berths  in  the  Crescent 
City,  bound  for  Havana.  On  reaching  the  pier  with 
our  luggage  and  all  prepared  for  the  voyage,  we  were 
very  coolly  told  that  the  Crescent  City  had  taken  her 
departure  for  California  the  night  before !  It  appears 
that  the  Georgia  (another  of  the  same  Company's 
vessels),  which  had  started  for  California  some  days 
previously,  broke  down  when  off  Cape  Hatteras ;  the 
Crescent  City  being  the  only  other  boat  ready,  she 
was  sent  to  the  assistance  of  the  Georgia  and  her 
passengers,  and  we  poor  unfortunate  mortals  were 
plantes  la.  After  a  long  delay  and  an  immense  deal 
of  talking,  they  at  last  promised  to  forward  us  by 
another  boat  called  the  George  Law,  though  not  before this  (the  16th),  and  at  night,  for  the  very  unsatisfactory  reason  that  this  vessel,  the  George  Law,  is 
not  yet  quite  finished !  All  this  is  exceedingly 
vexatious,  for,  among  other  consequences,  this  delay 
may  make  us  too  late  for  the  English  steamer  due  at 
Havana  on  the  24th,  in  which  event  farewell  to  our 
contemplated  trip  to  Mexico. 

7  o'clock,  P.M. — We  are  off  at  last
